            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE the EARL of <hi>ANGLESEY,</hi> Lord Privy Seal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE <hi>Manuſcript</hi> now herewith delivered to your Servant, had two days ſince been brought to Your Lordſhip, had I not ſo long diſputed with my ſelf, Whether it were more decent for me to ſend it
<pb facs="tcp:97884:3"/>
               <hi>ſingle,</hi> or to give it an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> for a companion. Nor was it ſo eaſie a matter for me to determin this my doubt; the contrary reaſons that offered themſelves to my perpenſion, ſeeming to me to be of equal weight</p>
            <p>When, on one ſide, I conſidered how immenſe a multiplicity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and thoſe of great importance too, come hourly crowding into your thoughts, expecting from you to be at once both judged and diſpatched with higheſt <hi>Prudence;</hi> and how few minutes you have to ſpare from cares of <hi>State:</hi> I was inclined to conclude, that the peruſal of the <hi>Book</hi> alone, without the importunity of a <hi>Letter,</hi> might too much interrupt your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and the public felicity. To this was added, that neither <hi>Socrates</hi> nor <hi>Plato</hi> could need Letters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to a man ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Heroic Virtues of
<pb facs="tcp:97884:3"/>
the one, and the Divine Doctrin of the other. Nay I thought it a kind of Sacrilege againſt their <hi>Merits,</hi> as well as againſt your <hi>Judgement,</hi> but to imagine, that any thing I could write to introduce them, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your eſteem of them.</p>
            <p>When, on the other, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd that the <hi>Book</hi> contains, not an Original, but a <hi>Copy;</hi> not the intire Images of thoſe two ſo juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> but only two ſelect <hi>pieces</hi> of them, namely the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and invincible <hi>Heart</hi> of the one, and the perſpicacious <hi>Eye</hi> of the other (I mean the <hi>Defenſe</hi> of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and the diſcourſe of the <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> of Mans <hi>Soul</hi>) and that I owed Your Lordſhip, not only the free uſe thereof, but alſo an accompt of the reaſons I had to allege in excuſe (I muſt not ſay, juſtification) of the little art ſhewn by me in the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97884:4"/>
remembring this, I ſay, I could not but think it convenient, to draw a few lines more, in order to your ſatisfaction concerning that particular. Beſides this, gratefully re-calling to mind, that you had long before honour'd me, not only with licence, but with expreſs <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> alſo, to write to you, and that frequently too, eſpecialy concerning matters <hi>Philoſophical;</hi> and being of opinion, that this <hi>Book</hi> contains one of the nobleſt Diſquiſitions any where to be found among the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of even the Ancient <hi>Grecian Philoſophers:</hi> I was apt to conceive it to be more probable (your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Candor</hi> together conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) that my omiſſion to do it, upon this inviting occaſion, might carry the face of <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> than that my doing it would be look'd upon as importune or indecent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97884:4"/>And this laſt reaſon, in weight exceeding all the moments put into the oppoſite Scale, at length turned the balance of my ſuſpence; and made me conclude, that certainly I ſhould leſs offend by a fault for which I might plead the authority of Your Lordſhips <hi>Command,</hi> than by one that could not be otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, but by confeſſing my diſtruſt of your <hi>Benignity,</hi> and diffidence of your <hi>Favour,</hi> wherein chiefly I eſteem my ſelf to be happy.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, I ſtill found my ſelf obliged, ſo far at leaſt to give ear to the former arguments that would have diſſuaded me from wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as to reſolve to make my fault as little and venial as was poſſible, by writing no more than ſhould ſeem neceſſary to the defens of the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>familiar Style</hi> uſed by me, in the <hi>verſion</hi> of theſe two ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:97884:5"/>
Diſcourſes of <hi>Plato</hi> into our Language. For that ſeems chiefly to require an Apology: the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Wiſedom,</hi> great <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility,</hi> and charming <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of the <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> themſelves, being already perfectly known to Your Lordſhip, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by univerſal conſent of the Learned in all ages, ſince it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a doubt, whether <hi>Athens</hi> were more to be honoured for the birth of <hi>Socrates,</hi> or to be branded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and hatred for the cruel mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of him. And as for the <hi>Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of my tranſlating them; you are ſo far from needing to be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed thereof, that you made it my Province: that is, from your juſt admiration of the incorruptible Juſtice of <hi>Socrates,</hi> expreſſed in a Colloquy at your Table (where the Minds, no leſs than the bodies of your Gueſts are always feaſted)
<pb facs="tcp:97884:5"/>
I took the firſt hint of the deſign, and proceeded therein by your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; which with me, is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to an injunction.</p>
            <p>Suffer me then, my <hi>Lord,</hi> briefly to acquaint you, that if in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of my pen, I have not only confined it, as ſtrictly as my weak judgement would permit me to do it, within the bounds of the Authors <hi>ſenſe;</hi> but cauſed it alſo whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I could, to trace out his very <hi>Expreſſions,</hi> and render them even word for word: it was not that I imagined that way to be either more facil, or more elegant; but becauſe I judged it to be the more <hi>faithful,</hi> and I had deſign'd, not a Paraphraſe, but a <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> By comparing the <hi>Latin</hi> verſion of <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> with that of <hi>Serranus,</hi> I had found theſe two great men not ſeldom vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſomtimes dubious, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:97884:6"/>
irreconciliable in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations: ſo that both could not be in the right; and to me who had not been ſufficiently verſed in the dialect and ſtyle of <hi>Plato,</hi> nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently skilled in the Criticiſms of the Greek, it was extremely diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to diſcern, which of the two came neareſt to the true and genuine ſenſe of the Author; more eſpecialy where it was probable they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed different <hi>Exemplars,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that even their beſt Editions of <hi>Plato</hi> were not ſufficiently correct. To extricate my ſelf from this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, I was conſtrained to take this courſe. Where the <hi>Greek Text</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me to be of it ſelf plain and perſpicuous, I ſeldom conſulted any other Oracle. Where the ſame ſeem'd obſcure by words of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous ſignification, and uſed <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricaly:</hi> firſt I ſought to let in
<pb facs="tcp:97884:6"/>
light upon the place, by opening the caſements both of the antecedent and ſubſequent <hi>Context;</hi> and if thereby I could diſcern the mind of thoſe words, I had recourſe to the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> alſo, though merely for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. Where I found my ſelf intangled both in the abſtruſeneſs of the Text, and in the diſcrepancy of its interpretations; I choſe to adhere to the more <hi>conſentaneous,</hi> which moſt frequently was that of <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> and where the interpretations were not only different, but inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conſiſtency and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation: there I was forced to grope out my way by probable <hi>Conjecture,</hi> as being deſtitute of other help. Here to expatiate into a particular Catalogue of theſe <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and adfer inſtances of each ſort of them; is neither to my preſent ſcope neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, nor conſiſtent with the module
<pb facs="tcp:97884:7"/>
of an Epiſtle: and after this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral accompt, it ſeems more decent for me to render a reaſon, why I ſo far mentioned them. Be pleaſed therefore to know, that I have done it, not to derogate from the glory and authority of thoſe two ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly celebrated names of <hi>Ficinus</hi> and <hi>Serranus,</hi> from whoſe immortal <hi>Works</hi> I hold my ſelf ſcarcely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to wipe the duſt, and without whoſe conduct and manuduction I could not have been able to proceed without ſtumbling at almoſt every ſtep: but only to make your Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leſs, when you ſhall find me, not only ſtumbling, but <hi>Erring</hi> alſo from the direct path of <hi>Plato</hi>'s ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and intention; which I fear I have more than once done. For, if ſuch men as they were, met ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Knots they could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: what wonder is it, that I who
<pb facs="tcp:97884:7"/>
am ſo much their inferior both in learning and judgement, ſhould be often embroil'd in doubts I cannot ſolve? if <hi>They</hi> who have ſhewn themſelves both exquiſitely Critical in the <hi>Greek</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and intimately converſant even in the moſt myſterious notions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found receſſes of the <hi>Platonic Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> openly diſſent from, and claſh one with the other, about the genuin ſenſe of many hundreds of places therein occurring: how much of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is due to this weak <hi>Eſſay</hi> of one, who is neither good <hi>Grecian,</hi> nor ſo much as a mean <hi>Platonist?</hi> I may therefore expect from Your Lordſhip, rather reprhenſion for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting above my ſtrength, than blame for performing below my hopes. Now, my Lord, that I may draw all the lines of this long Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph to a point; this very <hi>Reaſon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97884:8"/>
here brought to excuſe my <hi>Deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (if I be found guilty of any ſuch) from the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> may well ſerve alſo to juſtifie my ſtrict <hi>adheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the <hi>Words</hi> of my Author, whereſoever the vaſt diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the moſt ſignificant Idioms of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Greek,</hi> and thoſe of our <hi>Babel</hi> of Languages, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would permit. For, as a Novice in the Art of Painting, though he come ſhort of the life, will yet more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly repreſent the true dimenſions of the thing he deſigns to paint, and the becoming Symmetry of all its parts; if he tranſgreſs not the lines drawn to his hand by a Maſter, to circumſcribe the image, and confine his pencill to the due proportions thereof: ſo I being to copy the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> of Another, believ'd I ſhould be the leſs prone to err, by how much the leſs I receded from the <hi>Marks</hi> he
<pb facs="tcp:97884:8"/>
had left of them: and hereupon I reſolved to do my beſt devoir, firſt to underſtand thoſe <hi>Marks</hi> diſtinctly, and then to repreſent their <hi>Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> faithfully: preferring plain <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to more artificial ornament. Not that I had then forgot, there are intruth certain Modes of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and graceful <hi>Phraſes</hi> proper and peculiar to every Language, ſo as to be incapable of alienation or tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and certain <hi>Subjects</hi> alſo that are, as by natural congruity, much more agreeably and patheticaly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by one Tongue, than by any other: and that therefore a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ought to be allowed competent liberty to uſe ſuch words, phraſes and figures of ſpeech, as he ſhall judge moſt fit, as well to conſerve the beauty and elegance of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conception, as to ſymbolize and ſuit with the argument; and this leſt
<pb facs="tcp:97884:9"/>
his ſtyle become pedantique and flat, and the Matter it ſelf be debaſed, as the beſt Wines loſe their Spirit by transfuſion from veſſel to veſſel. But that I well remembred, that an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Wit</hi> of Your Lordſhips acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who had with ſeverity enough declamed againſt <hi>verbal</hi> Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was yet at the ſame time ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, as to grant ſome Books to be of ſo great and univerſal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as that not only their Senſe, but even their <hi>Words</hi> too ought to be reputed <hi>Sacred:</hi> and that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe two pieces of <hi>Plato,</hi> more eſpecialy that of the <hi>Soul,</hi> whereof the Speculations are for the moſt part <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> or <hi>Theological,</hi> deſerved to be of that number. Hereunto was conjoyned a Second conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to the Words of the Text, even in the Ornamental parts of the
<pb facs="tcp:97884:9"/>
Diſcours, I might not only the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter avoid the danger of either ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the Expreſſions, or offering ſuch violence to the Senſe of it, as might make it appear rather mine than my Authors; but alſo retain ſome impreſſions of the civil manner and way uſed by thoſe Ancient <hi>Sages</hi> in their frank <hi>Conferences,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate <hi>Diſputations</hi> concerning matters Philoſophical: a thing not unworthy the ſerious notice of thoſe who are ſtrangers to the <hi>Atticiſm</hi> and admirable Civility of <hi>Plato;</hi> and, the Moroſity and obſtinacy of our Modern Diſputants conſidered, to all Exemplary. Theſe, <hi>my good Lord,</hi> are the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that induced me to labour to ſhew my ſelf, in this diverting Eſſay, rather <hi>fidum Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſten,</hi> than <hi>diſertum Paraphraſten;</hi> rather <hi>just</hi> than <hi>polite.</hi> And as for the plainneſs of my <hi>style</hi> (if that
<pb facs="tcp:97884:10"/>
be a fault) though it be the natural conſequent of my fidelity; yet I have this further to plead in defenſe thereof, that the <hi>gravity</hi> of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> exacted it: for, as the Prince of Roman Stoics moſt judiciouſly obſerves (<hi>Epist.</hi> 40.) <hi>quae veritati operam dat oratio, incompoſita debet eſſe &amp; ſimplex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto, my <hi>Lord,</hi> I have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt your patience, by forcing you to hear <hi>my</hi> Apology: be pleas'd now to let me expiate that offens, by exerciſing the ſame a minute or two longer, while I recall into your memory ſome of thoſe many Heroic Virtues of <hi>Socrates,</hi> whereof his grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſciple, <hi>Plato,</hi> hath left to us ſuch remarkable inſtances, both in his <hi>Apology,</hi> and in the accurate nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the manner and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97884:10"/>This poor Philoſopher, <hi>my Lord,</hi> ſeems to be the man upon whom the bounty of Heaven accumulated all the various <hi>Gifts,</hi> it uſeth to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute but ſingly and with a ſparing hand to other Mortals: and the leaſt of his divine Endowments hath often ſufficed to render even private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons illuſtrous, and <hi>Sceptres</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more auguſt.</p>
            <p>Had you beheld him in arms, with his Sword reſcuing <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and ſtanding alone confronting a victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous army, when the <hi>Athenian</hi> forces fled from the battell of <hi>Delium:</hi> you would have ſeen <hi>Wiſedom</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to <hi>Warre, Judgement</hi> moving hand in hand with <hi>Fury,</hi> and the <hi>Rational</hi> faculty of the Soul concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the ſame action with the <hi>Iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible;</hi> and thereupon concluded, that true <hi>Valour</hi> ariſes, not from heat of blood, nor from exceſs of Choler,
<pb facs="tcp:97884:11"/>
but from ſtrength and reſolution of <hi>Mind;</hi> and that a good <hi>Philoſopher</hi> may make an excellent <hi>Captain.</hi> Had you ſeen him in another Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, returning a Conquerour from <hi>Potidaea,</hi> and transferring all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and rewards due to ſo ſignal a victory, upon his beloved <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> reſerving to himſelf no other place in the Triumph but among the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of his Friend: You might have ſworn, he had fought ſo brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rather for <hi>Conſcience,</hi> than for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glory or Spoyl; and that he deſired no greater name than that of a good <hi>Patriot</hi> and ſincere <hi>Friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you reflect upon his fearleſs refuſal to execute the Command he had received from the ſupreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Athens,</hi> to fetch <hi>Leo Salami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> from <hi>Salamine,</hi> to be put to death, according to the Sentence given againſt him by the Uſurper <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97884:11"/>
and his Adherents: you will (I preſume) acknowledge, that he fear'd nothing but to do ill, that he diſdain'd to aſſert any power that was not juſt, that <hi>Athens</hi> it ſelf might with more eaſe have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Salamine,</hi> than he brought to relinquiſh <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Equity;</hi> and that he was more ready to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the oppreſſed in their Sufferings under Tyranny, than to be a ſharer in the adminiſtration of it. Had ſome <hi>Roman</hi> been a witneſs of this virtuous obſtinacy, he would have cried out perhaps, that the <hi>Capitol</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was not more immoveable than the integrity of <hi>Socrates;</hi> and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Greece</hi> the glory of ſo rare an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. What then would he have ſaid. <hi>my Lord,</hi> had he been preſent at the diſpute betwixt the ſame <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and his moſt faithful Scholar <hi>Crito,</hi> wherein he being with no weak
<pb facs="tcp:97884:12"/>
arguments urged, to evade the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that moſt unjuſt Sentence lately paſs'd upon him, and deliver himſelf from violent death by an eſcape plotted and prepared to his hand; nevertheleſs not only rejected that affectionate advice, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration convinced the Author of it, that the auctority of Law, and Decrees of Courts of Judicature, are things in their ſanction ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſacred, as to oblige men to ſubmiſſion, even when they are manifeſtly unjuſt; and brought him at length to acquieſce in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>nefas ſibi eſſe è carcere egredi, injuſſu Magiſtratus, &amp; contra legum autoritatem?</hi> Herein whether <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> were in the right or not, let our <hi>Civilians</hi> determin: I, for my part, verily believe, he thought he was; and this is moſt evident, that he could never be either overcome by terrors,
<pb facs="tcp:97884:12"/>
or won by allurements, to recede ſo much as a hairs bredth from what he had once defined to be <hi>juſt.</hi> This very <hi>Monoſyllable</hi> doubtleſs was his whole <hi>Decalogue,</hi> equivalent to the Laws of the <hi>twelve Tables</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>baſis</hi> of his Religion, the Centre of his Counſels, and rule to his actions: nor can I be eaſily perſuaded, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> left to dwell among men untill after his death. Of his obedience to the Laws and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of his City, he gave this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimony; that when the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Republic, to repair their people much exhauſted by warre and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, had made an Edict, that every man of fit years ſhould be obliged to eſpouſe one woman, as principal wife, and have liberty to take another, for procreation: he, notwithſtanding he had his hands full of unquiet <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippe</hi> (whoſe peeviſhneſs and moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb facs="tcp:97884:13"/>
was grown to be the daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his patience at home, and his reproch abroad) yet in conformity to the Edict, fear'd not to receive into his little houſe and narrow bed, another Conſort alſo, one <hi>Myrto,</hi> daughter of that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Juſt,</hi> but equaly poor with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This certainly could not but be ſomwhat harſh and diſagreeable to a man already entered into the confines of old age, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the pleaſures of ſerenity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and yet I muſt not imagin it to have been at all difficult to the wiſedom of our <hi>Socrates,</hi> whoſe tranquillity appears to have been ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, like the head of mount <hi>Athos,</hi> above the tempeſt of feminin conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, jealouſies and impertinences, and his Mind incapable of pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>turba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. However, he put not private cares into the balance againſt a duty
<pb facs="tcp:97884:13"/>
to the Public: but choſe to be a good Citiſen, by increaſing Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though he were ſure thereby to multiply his own domeſtic incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p>Acting by this infallible principle of <hi>Justice</hi> (which is, as <hi>Plato</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the greateſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man goods, and Mother of all other virtues) and fully perſuaded of the divinity and immortality of the Soul (which is the fundament of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) and of future rewards and puniſhments: the wonder is the leſs, that this admirable man was able, both to trample upon all the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and precious things of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany life, and to bid defiance to all the terrible: for, ſecure in his own innocence, and confident of happineſs to come; 'twas leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to him either to contemn dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or reſiſt temptations. Nay,
<pb facs="tcp:97884:14"/>
to do him right, neither could this <hi>Temperance,</hi> nor that <hi>Fortitude</hi> be at all difficult to him, who by long uſe, and continual practice, had exalted them from Virtues into <hi>Habits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt,</hi> he appear'd to be ſo perfect, that tho as a man he could not but feel the motions and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Corporeal <hi>Appetites,</hi> yet none of them dared to rebell againſt the Soveraignty of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> by whoſe power he alwaies both ruled and bounded them: nor could even a good Soul ſeparated from its body, and delivered from all encumbrances of Matter, have acted more ſedately, or been leſs incommodated with <hi>Paſſions.</hi> In a word, in his whole life, he ſeem'd not only unconcern'd in, but <hi>inſenſible</hi> of the vain appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of human things.</p>
            <p>Being thus impenetrable to Cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, it may be worth our labour to
<pb facs="tcp:97884:14"/>
enquire alſo, how ſtrong he was againſt <hi>Fear.</hi> That we may therefore take the true hight of his Courage, let us (if it pleaſe Your Lordſhip) obſerve his deportment at the bar, in the priſon, and at his death.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> we hear his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi> no leſs than his Innocency tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over the power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his combined Accuſers: <hi>the greatest hurt they can do to me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is to think it poſſible to hurt me; ſince God takes care of Good men, and they therefore can never be violated by wicked men.</hi> To a friend whiſpering in his ear, that his Judges had before reſolved to doom him to death: he anſwers ſoftly and with a ſmile (but ſuch a ſmile as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an aire of Gravity and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) <hi>and hath not Nature paſſed the ſame doom upon them?</hi> Retiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his condemnation, <hi>Adieu my
<pb facs="tcp:97884:15"/>
friends,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am now going to ſuffer death, ye to enjoy life: God alone knows, which of the two is better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Priſon,</hi> we find him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil'd of whatever Fortune could take from him, his body covered with raggs and loaden with chains, his leggs galled and cramp'd with fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his eyes entertain'd with no objects but a wife and Infant weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and yet for all this, we hear no complaints, no lamentations, no grones, no not ſo much as one ſigh come from him; but diſcourſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory and divine. Good God, how great is the power of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! how invincible the courage of a Soul armed with virtue! If this mans condition be Happy (as certainly it is) how much are Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals generaly miſtaken in the notion of Happineſs! Here we behold a
<pb facs="tcp:97884:15"/>
ſhew of Miſery in extremity: but realy there is no ſuch thing. For if you look more intently upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> you ſhall diſcern in him all the ſigns of alacrity, all the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Joy. To ſee him ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, a man would think, he were not a Sufferer, but a Comforter. There is (Your Lordſhip well knows) a ſort of <hi>natural Authority</hi> inherent in the very Perſons of ſome men, reſulting perhaps from certain characters of a great Mind, which heroic virtue imprints upon their countenance: and this as it corrects the imperfections of nature, where it meets with any; ſo doth it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe adorn the nakedneſs of its owner expoſed to the outrages of fortune, illuminate his dungeon, and ſtrike fear and reverence into the heart of even Executioners; as you may remember it did into his, who came
<pb facs="tcp:97884:16"/>
to kill that noble Roman, <hi>Caius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> Now this indelible Character of true Greatneſs, do I clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the face of our <hi>Hero's,</hi> with its rayes enlightning the obſcurity of his priſon, conſecrating his diſgraces, chains and raggs, and rendring his afflictions holy and venerable. Nor can his Executioner endure the flaſhes of it, without aſtoniſhment, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and tears: and you may hear him, after a little recollection of himſelf, ſobbing forth this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement. <hi>Farewell</hi> Socrates, ſaith he, <hi>The moſt generous and beſt of Men that ever came into this place.</hi> Which words being imperfectly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he inſtantly retires; and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform the duety of his place, he ſends in another with the poyſon.</p>
            <p>Which being preſented to <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> behold with what calmneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:97884:16"/>
Spirit, what gravity of aſpect, and how ſteady a hand he receives it, and drinks, as if that draught were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh, not his life, but thirſt. Nor did his <hi>Fortitude</hi> grow cold with his blood, or ſink with his vital powers; for even in the extreme agony of death, in the laſt pulſe of his heart, when the vital flame ceaſed to warm him: then did the flame of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſtill continue, and animated him to breath forth words that ſignifie, his diſſolution was moſt grateful to him, as a deliverance from the Sickneſs of Mortality, and paſſage to immortal Happineſs. Which I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, he now enjoys: his whole life ſeeming to me, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ingenuouſly declared it did to him, nothing but a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>justice, temperance</hi> and <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> ſo that if ever any among the <hi>Ethnics</hi> came neer to the perfection
<pb facs="tcp:97884:17"/>
of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> life, it cannot be denied but <hi>Socrates</hi> was the man. It is not (I profeſs) my cuſtom to addreſs my praiers to any but God alone, who (I am moſt certain) both hears, and hath power to grant my petitions: and yet I bluſh not to confeſs, that whenever I read what <hi>Plato, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, Eunapius Sardia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> among the Greeks, and <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> among the Latins, have written in commemoration of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable virtues of this righteous man; I find my ſelf ſtrongly inclined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame, <hi>O ſancte Socrates ora pro nobis!</hi> an ejaculation expreſly owned even by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> himſelf, whom Your Lordſhip well knows to have been free enough from Superſtition: nor raſhly to be condemned; <hi>nam fortaſſe latius ſe diffundit Spiritus Chriſti, quam nos interpretamur; &amp; multi ſunt in conſortio Sanctorum, qui non ſunt apud nos in catalogo.</hi>

            <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SOCRATES</hi> being accuſed of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety by <hi>Melitus, Anitus,</hi> and <hi>Lycon,</hi> before the People of <hi>Athens,</hi> by this Oration defends his Cauſe: And he ſo pleads, that he not only evinceth this their accuſation to be falſe and malitious; but alſo clearly ſheweth, that on the contrary, he deſerved well of the Republick, and was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97884:21"/>
therefore worthy not of puniſhment, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. He moreover declares, that it was a <hi>Duty</hi> divinely impoſed upon him, to reprove and convince Men; more particularly ſuch, who being puffed up with a vain Opinion of their own Wiſdom, were highly conceited of themſelves. The infection of which ambitious folly he affirms to be diffus'd amongſt Men of all Orders: But that alone is true Wiſdom, when men acknowledg their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> (that is, as he in moſt proper words defines, that Humane wiſdom is of ſmall value, or none at all;) and firmly hold, that God alone is wiſe. Hereupon he declares, that himſelf had been judged by the Oracle <hi>wiſer</hi> than all other men, for no other reaſon but this, That he differently from the cuſtom of all others, had no esteem of himſelf, and thought he knew nothing certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>but that he knew nothing.</hi> Then he makes the Author of that his Office or Duty of reprehending and informing Men, to be <hi>God:</hi> by whoſe certain command he avows he did whatſoever he had done in that kind. And this Command of <hi>God</hi> he calls [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,] a <hi>Spiritual Intelligence,</hi> a <hi>Voice,</hi> a <hi>Sign:</hi> By thoſe words, in way of excellency, deſigning not any power of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wit, but a certain Divine and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſignification; and (as we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97884:21"/>
call it) <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> whereby he was ſecretly admoniſhed, what he ought to do, and what not. He calls it <hi>Daemonium,</hi> a ſpiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; Becauſe he conceived that Power to come, not from Man, but from God: and otherwiſe terms the ſame, <hi>Vocem</hi> &amp; <hi>Signum,</hi> in reſpect of that private admonition, which he affirms hath been given to him by a perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Voice, by manifest and true Dreams, and by other ways of Intimation. Thus much we briefly and plainly (according to what we could collect from the words of <hi>Plato</hi>) obſerve concerning the <hi>Daemonium</hi> of <hi>Socrates;</hi> That we might not be obliged to amuſe our ſelves with the Myſterious Comments of various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters. By the <hi>auſpice</hi> therefore, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of this his Divine Dictator, <hi>Socrates</hi> avers, that even from his Childhood he had ordered and governed his whole life, and made it his grand buſineſs to convince of Ignorance, Men inflated with the ambitious confidence of Science. From this contagious Fountain he derives that torrent of hatred with which very many of his Fellow-Citizens now ſought to overwhelm him; And from thence he deduces his preſent accuſation. Nevertheleſs, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to be immovably fixed in this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, always to obey the Counſel of God, nor ever to leave any part of that his principal duty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97884:22"/>
unperformed, though it ſhould be conjoyn'd with manifeſt danger of his life: The loſs whereof he feared not, nor any thing elſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this, leſt he ſhould be found not to have conformed himſelf to the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of God. Resting upon this reſolve, he denies that he would by Prayers and Intreaties (as was the manner of the <hi>Athenians</hi>) beg favour and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from his Judges: But commending the iſſue of his Cauſe to God, and to the will of his Judges, would conſtantly perſevere in his own determinate courſe. Therefore when it was left to his own option, whether he would go into exile, or die; he choſe rather to die: teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that even in Death it ſelf, he ſhould not fail of certain Felicity; being fully perſwaded that God took care of him and his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This was the Condemnation of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> from whence <hi>Plato</hi> endeavours to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that he was undeſervedly accuſed of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. Thus then <hi>Socrates</hi> ſuffered Death, for that he refuted the falſe Doctrines of Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion: Though it be not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that he was ignorant of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion taught by the ſacred word of God. Yet among <hi>Ethnics</hi> there was this clear teſtimony extant of an <hi>Ethnic Philoſopher,</hi> to take from them all excuſe of Ignorance: Since beſides that natural knowledge, which God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven

Beſides this, the number of my accuſers of this ſort is great; and their accuſations are of a long date, inſinuated and ingraffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your minds, in that age which is credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and eaſie to admit any perſwaſions, when moſt of you were boys, or rather lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children: ſo that they accuſed me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind my back, and while I had no compur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator, no advocate to vindicate me; and (what is extremely unjuſt, and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) I was not permitted either to know, or to produce the names of my accuſers. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was a confuſed whiſper, a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom muttering in the general, that it was a certain Comical Poet. And they who by envy and calumny traduce me to you, and breed in your minds an odium againſt me; have ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed themſelves with the crimes objected to me, that they draw others alſo into the ſame perſwaſion: but thoſe no where appear in the light. For I can by no means obtain, that any one of them ſhould be brought hither to confront me, that I might have the liberty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97884:25"/>
to confute him: but am forced, while I make my defence againſt them, and endeavour to convince them of forgery; to combate as it were in the dark, no man appearing in the Liſts to anſwer me. Know this therefore, and conſider with your ſelves, that I have two ſorts of accuſers: ſome who have but even now accuſed me; others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain who have been long verſed in this clandeſtine practiſe, of whom I ſpeak: and think that I am obliged to make anſwer to thoſe in the firſt place. Let it be ſo then, that I muſt form a defence for my ſelf, and do my utmoſt devoir, in this ſhort time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me, to remove and extirpate that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter opinion, which hath for a long time remained deeply rooted in your minds to my prejudice. This I would wiſh might be effected, to your and my own benefit: for in this my defence, I ſhould deſire to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſomewhat more. But that I conceive to be weighty and difficult: nor am I ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what will be the event of my Trial. Yet let the iſſue be ſuch, as may be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God; I muſt obey the Law, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>Fetching then the firſt riſe of my wrongs from their Original, let us ſee in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt what is that accuſation, from whence

am able to produce many witneſſes: and I would intreat you, that you inform each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and enquire among your ſelves, who have ever heard me diſcourſing of any ſuch matters; and there are many preſent, who have frequently heard me in free and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conferences.

For each of theſe are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to what Cities ſoever they travel, to perſwade young men, (and yet it was lawfull for them frankly to converſe with whomſoever they liked beſt of their own Citizens,) that quitting the converſe of all

There is here preſent alſo another certain man, a <hi>Parian,</hi> and wiſe, whoſe reſidence in this City was grateful to me. For I by chance lighted upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon, who gave more mony to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists,</hi> than all others; namely <hi>Gallias</hi> the Son of <hi>Hipponichus;</hi> and of him I asked this queſtion. Thou haſt two Sons, <hi>Gallias.</hi> If thoſe thy two Sons were Calves or Colts, doubtleſs we ſhould have ſome one ſet to be their <hi>Tutor,</hi> and a reward given to him, to teach them, each according to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Genius and capacity; (for he ſhould be skilful in Horſmanſhip, or in Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) whereas now tho they be men, thou yet takeſt no care to provide them a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and Governor. Who is there know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and expert in this art of Humanity and Civility? I ſuppoſe, that being a Father of Sons, thou haſt conſidered of this matter. Is there (ſaid I) any man fit for this charge, or not? and for how much doth he teach? <hi>Evenus</hi> (anſwers he) the <hi>Parian,</hi> O <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> and his demand is five Attic <hi>Minae.</hi> And I preſently commended <hi>Evenus,</hi> as a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97884:27"/>
happy man, if he were really endowed with this moſt uſefull art, and taught ſo ſtudiouſly and dextrouſly. Truely I ſhould glory, and boaſt my ſelf, were I knowing in theſe things: but I profeſs my ſelf, <hi>Athenians,</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacquainted with them.

For unleſs thou didſt often do ſomething very remarkable, ſingular and very different from the cuſtom of others; ſo great a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor would not have flown abroad concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thee. For why ſhould this ignominy have faln upon thee, if thou hadſt done nothing ſtrange and unvulgar? Tell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what it is, leſt we, not underſtanding the matter, give a raſh judgement of thee. Who urges this, may ſeem to have reaſon for it. And I therefore will endeavour to lay before you what it is, that hath procured to me both a name and blame. Hear ye then, and tho to ſome of you I may ſeem to jeſt and droll; yet be moſt confident of this, that I will declare to you the whole truth. For I <hi>Athenians,</hi> have upon no other ground,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97884:27"/>
but that of ſome certain Wiſdom, acquired this name. But what Wiſedom? that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, which is humane wiſedom. For with that I ſeem really to be endowed. Theſe perchance, whom I lately named, may be enriched with ſome greater wiſedom than that which is incident to man. To this I can oppoſe nothing; for ſuch wiſdom I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not. But whoſoever ſaith this, doth lie, and ſay it on purpoſe to raiſe an odium againſt me by calumny. Nor be ye <hi>Athenians</hi> diſcompoſed, if I ſhall ſeem to declare to you ſomething that is great and remarkable. For I will deliver nothing from my ſelf, but refer to him who is above all exception, who will himſelf communicate the ſame things to you. For of my wiſdom, if I have any, ſuch as it is,<note place="margin">He juſtifies his practice of <hi>reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> others, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging the expreſs command of <hi>God,</hi> whom he ought to obey.</note> I will give you for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that <hi>Delphic God. Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephon</hi> ye all well know. He was my familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion even from the time when we were boys together; and alſo your Countrey-man: who both fled, and return'd with you: and you cannot but remember of what humour and diſpoſition he was; who vehement, whatſoever he undertok. And indeed when on a time he came to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97884:28"/>
                  <hi>Delphos,</hi> he had the boldneſs to conſult the <hi>Oracle</hi> about this matter. Be not (I beſeech you) <hi>Athenians,</hi> moved to a tumult by what I ſhall ſpeak. He inquired of the God, if there were any man wiſer than my ſelf: and <hi>Pythia</hi> anſwered, none was wiſer. The truth hereof, the Brother of that <hi>Cherephon</hi> will atteſt: for he is dead. Now ſeriouſly conſider, I pray, why I recount this to you. For I am coming to explain the cauſe, whence this calumny againſt me firſt aroſe. When I had heard of <hi>Cherephons</hi> adventure, I thus thought in my mind. What doth the God ſay? or what doth he ſignifie by theſe words? For I eſteem not my ſelf to be wiſe neither little nor much. What then can be his meaning, when he affirms that I am the wiſeſt of men? Lye he doth not, for that is to a God impoſſible. And long did I remain in doubt, profoundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his words: then not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty I converted my ſelf to a certain diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this kind. I came to one of thoſe who ſeemed to be wiſe, in hope I might here convince the ſaying of the Oracle, and ſo commonſtrate that he, not I (as the God had ſaid) was the wiſer. When therefore I had together with him examined the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (I need not name the man: he is one
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97884:28"/>
of thoſe who are imployed in Governing the Common-wealth, and managing Affairs of State) when (I ſay) I had conferred with him, ſomewhat of the like nature, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> hapned to me. He ſeemed to me indeed to be accounted wiſe, both by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and thoſe many, and by himſelf chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but was not really ſo. Then I endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to demonſtrate to him, that though he thought himſelf wiſe, yet he was not ſo in reality. Hereby I fell into the diſpleaſure and ill-will of him, and of very many others who were preſent: But retiring thence, I thought with my ſelf, that I was wiſer than that man, becauſe neither of us ſeemed to know anything Noble or Excellent: only he (thought I to my ſelf) believes he knows ſomething, when he knows nothing; but I, as I know nothing, ſo I think I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Herein therefore I took my ſelf to be a little wiſer of the two: in that I decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not my ſelf with an Opinion that I knew that, whereof really I was ignorant. After this I addreſſed to another, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet wiſer than the firſt: but found no difference betwixt them, as to wiſdom. Whereupon I incurred his hatred alſo, and that of many of his Admirers. Then I went likewiſe to others; being ſenſible of my ill
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97884:29"/>
ſucceſs, and grieved ſufficiently therewith, as much fearing leſt I might ſtir up hatred and envy againſt my ſelf: Nevertheleſs I conceived my ſelf under an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of highly valuing the voice of God, and turning my ſelf to all parts, by going to all thoſe who thought they knew ſomething, that in the end I might explore the true ſenſe of the Oracle.

'Tis fit and pertinent, that <hi>I</hi> ſhew you my Errors, what great pains <hi>I</hi> took, to render the Faith and Authority of the Oracle Sacred and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with me. After theſe States-men and Grandees, <hi>I</hi> addreſſed my ſelf to <hi>Poets,</hi> and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97884:29"/>
Writers of <hi>Tragedies</hi> and <hi>Dithyrambios,</hi> and others of the ſame Tribe: as if here <hi>I</hi> ſhould perſpicuouſly, and by Surpriſe (as they ſay) diſcover, that <hi>I</hi> was more unskilful, more ignorant than they. Taking therefore their <hi>Poems</hi> into my hands, and noting thoſe things they ſeemed to have written with greater ſubtilty, and higher ſtrains of Wit; <hi>I</hi> diligently asked them, what they could ſay, that <hi>I</hi> might at the ſame time learn ſomething from them? <hi>I</hi> bluſh to tell you the truth, <hi>Athenians:</hi> but do it <hi>I</hi> muſt, though very briefly: all that were preſent almoſt ſpake more favourably of thoſe <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems,</hi> than they who had made them. So <hi>I</hi> ſoon found concerning <hi>Poets,</hi> that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what they do, not by the power of Wiſdom, but by a certain <hi>impetus</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and fury of Divine incitement; as <hi>Prophets</hi> fore-tell things by Divine inſtinct or Enthuſiaſm, propheſying many Noble and Notable things, but not underſtanding ſo much as one word of what they deliver. With the ſame affection <hi>Poets</hi> appeared to me to be inſpired and incited: and <hi>I</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered likewiſe, that they, upon the account of their faculty in Poetry, think themſelves the wiſeſt of all men, even in other things; whereof notwithſtanding they are utterly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97884:30"/>
ignorant. From theſe therefore I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as from the former, and with the ſame reaſon too: thinking my ſelf to excel, as the <hi>Politicians,</hi> ſo likewiſe the <hi>Poets.</hi> At length <hi>I</hi> betook my ſelf to <hi>Artificers</hi> of <hi>Mechanic</hi> Works: conſcious to my ſelf, that in thoſe <hi>I</hi> knew nothing at all, (<hi>I</hi> comprehend all in a word) and well underſtanding, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould find thoſe plain People to have knowledge of many and excellent things. Nor did my opinion deceive me, for they knew things that <hi>I</hi> underſtood not, and were ſo far wiſer than <hi>I.</hi> Yet even the moſt eminent <hi>Artificers</hi> ſeemed involved in the very ſame Fault with the <hi>Poets;</hi> in that they alſo, becauſe they had ſhewn themſelves great Maſters in their Mechanics, would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one be accounted moſt skilful alſo in other even the greateſt matters; and this Fault of theirs wholly darkens the lights of their skill. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> interrogated my ſelf alſo, about the ſenſe of the Oracle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>I</hi> had rather be as <hi>I</hi> was; neither wiſe with their wiſdom, nor unskilful with their unskilfulneſs: or be, as they are, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſpoſed both wayes; and <hi>I</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my ſelf and the Oracle, that it was more commodious and profitable to me, to be as <hi>I</hi> am.

many offences, and thoſe moſt difficult too, and grievous, have come againſt me; and thence as many imputations, ſcandals, and criminations, and calumnies: and ſo it came to paſs, that <hi>I</hi> was named the <hi>wiſe</hi> man. For they who are in my company, daily ſuppoſe me to be ſingularly knowing in thoſe matters, wherein <hi>I</hi> reprehend and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince other mens errors.<note place="margin">His Explanation of the ſenſe of the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi>
                  </note> But it ſeems, <hi>Athenians,</hi> that <hi>God alone is wiſe:</hi> and the ſenſe of the Oracle this, that <hi>Humane wiſdom is to be very little or nothing eſteemed.</hi> And the Oracle expreſly nominated <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> for no other reaſon but this, that by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing my name, it might propoſe me as an <hi>example:</hi> as if it would ſay, this man, O Mortals, is the wiſeſt of ye all, who, as <hi>Socrates,</hi> well knows, that as to wiſdom, he is not to be valued at all. Being then of this temper of mind, I to this very day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſtrictly every where, and according to the words of that Divine Oracle, ſeek both among my Fellow-Citizens, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, if <hi>I</hi> can find a man worthy to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiſe: but when <hi>I</hi> diſcern any not to be really wiſe, truly out of Conformity to God, <hi>I</hi> clearly demonſtrate him to be not wiſe.

good Work, <hi>I</hi> have no leiſure allowed me, neither to Tranſact any public affair of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor to regulate my own Domeſtic concerns; but am caſt into the ſtreights of profound poverty, by reaſon of that my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God.

Thou ſeeſt, <hi>Melitus,</hi> thou art ſilent, and haſt not a word to reply: Nor doth it ſeem to misbecome thee; and ſo is a juſt Argument thou never troubledſt thy Head with this care: yet tell me, in good earneſt, who may make theſe better? <hi>The Laws.</hi> Of that I enquire not: but what man, who firſt hath known alſo this very thing, namely the Laws. <hi>Theſe Judges, Socrates.</hi> How ſayeſt thou <hi>Melitus?</hi> can theſe teach young men, and refine them? <hi>yes.</hi> Can all theſe, or ſome of them do that work, and others not? <hi>All.</hi> Thou ſayeſt well, by <hi>Juno;</hi> and doſt commemorate good ſtore of thoſe who are able to help. But what? can theſe <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> alſo reform men? <hi>They can.</hi> And the <hi>Senators</hi> too? The <hi>Senators</hi> alſo. Well then, <hi>Melitus;</hi> we muſt now ſee whether they who make Speeches to the people, corrupt young men, or reform them. <hi>And theſe too.</hi> It ſeems then, <hi>Athenians,</hi> that all render young men good and honeſt, except my ſelf, who alone debauch them. Saiſt thou ſo? I again and again affirm it. Thou imprinteſt upon me a brand of great infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city indeed: but anſwer me, haſt thou the ſame Opinion of Horſes alſo? do all men make them better, one only excepted, who corrupts them? or the contrary to this, is

there any one who can do it: or few skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Horſemanſhip, but on the contrary many, who while they dreſs, manage and uſe Horſes, wholly ſpoil them? is it not ſo of both Horſes, and all other Animals? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is, whether thou and <hi>Anytus</hi> affirm or deny it. Since young men would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a certain very high felicity, if there were only one to corrupt them, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides would improve them, But thou, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus</hi> haſt ſufficiently demonſtrated, that thou takeſt no care of young men: and clearly ſheweſt thy negligence, that thou haſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laboured in theſe matters, whereof thou accuſeſt me.<note place="margin">The falſitie of the ſame Article evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced alſo by this; that if <hi>Socrates</hi> had corrupted Youth, <hi>Melitus</hi> ought, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the Law, firſt to have privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſhed him, before he had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him thereof to the Magiſtrates: but this he had never done: <hi>Ergo.</hi>

Is there any who had rather receive damage from thoſe with whom he converſeth, than benefit?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97884:34"/>
Anſwer, prithee; for the Law commands thee to Anſwer: Is any willing to ſuffer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment? By no means. Go too then; ſeeing thou haſt hurried me into Judgement, as a corrupter of youth, and Patron of Vice; do I this willingly, or unwillingly? Willingly, as I conceive. What then, <hi>Melitus?</hi> art thou ſo much Wiſer than I? thou a young man, doſt thou? ſo far excel me an old one, as to underſtand, that evil men bring evil upon thoſe who chiefly converſe with them; but good men bring good? and am I ſo great a Fool, as not to underſtand this, that if I debauch any Familiar, I ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuffering ſome Evil from him: and ſo ſhall be willing to pull this ſo great Evil upon my ſelf, as thou ſaiſt? Herein, <hi>Melitus,</hi> I believe thee not, nor (I think) doth any man elſe. Wherefore either I do not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt youth, or I do it againſt my will: ſo that thou lyeſt in both. If I corrupt <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,</hi> the Law forbids all ſuch to be brought hither into Judgment, who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended unwillingly; but commands they be privatly both inſtructed and admoniſhed. For manifeſt it is, that upon inſtruction, I ſhould ceaſe to do what I did againſt my will: but thou haſt avoided and declined to converſe with me, and to admoniſh me;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97884:34"/>
and inſtead of that, forceſt me to this place of Judgement, whither the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires only ſuch incorrigible Offenders to be brought, who need rather Coercion then admonition.

Now would Young men learn from me theſe Doctrines, which they might ſometimes pick up from the Muſic-room of the Play-houſe, for not much more than a dragm? I allow thee to laugh at <hi>Socrates,</hi> if he feigned theſe Opinions to be his, when they are wholly abſurd and fooliſh.

               <p>Conſider with me, how he ſeems to ſpeak this contradiction; and do thou <hi>Melitus,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us: and ye remember (as I beſought you before) not to be diſordered to a Tumult,<note place="margin">Another <hi>anſwer</hi> from the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of his Adverſaries.

In fine, I ſhall anſwer to theſe things, do ye, <hi>Athenians,</hi> believe <hi>Anytus,</hi> or not; diſcharge me, or not; do according to your pleaſure: I will never do any thing but this, though I were to ſuffer many deaths. Be not diſturbed, <hi>Athenians,</hi> but continue the calm attention I begged of ye; leſt you excite a tumult by reaſon of what I ſhall ſpeak: but hear me patiently. Which if ye ſhall do ye will (I think) receive from thence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97884:40"/>
no little emolument. Other things beſides I ſhall ſpeak, that perhaps will move ye to exclame: but pray, forbear to do ſo. For be well aſſured, that if ye ſhall put me to death, me, ſuch a man as I deſcribe myſelf to be: ye will bring greater loſs to your City, to your ſelves, than to me: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall <hi>Melitus,</hi> nor <hi>Anytus</hi> hurt me in the leaſt, nor could they. Since I think it <hi>impoſſible, that a good man ſhould be violated by a wicked man.</hi> He will murder me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, or expel, or diſgrace me; and he, and ſome others will account thoſe to be great evils: but I think them not to be ſuch. Nay I rather hold, that to do the actions that he doth, is a great evil indeed: for he attempts to inflict puniſhment unjuſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an innocent man. Now therefore <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> I am ſo far from making a Defenſe for my ſelf (as ſome may expect) that I will ſpeak rather for your ſakes; leſt by giving ſentence againſt me, ye hainouſly ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>gift of God that is in me:</hi>

I will tell ye things Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, and pertinent to this way of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſes in Court, yet true. For, I, <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> never bore Office in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet attained to the dignity of <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> and our Tribe <hi>Antiochis</hi> obtained the Lieutenancy of the Supream power, when
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97884:43"/>
ye cenſured ten Military Officers to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, for not burying the ſlain in a Naval fight, and this againſt Law, as ye after judged. Then I being one of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> oppoſed you, that ye might not give a judgment contrary to Law; and made a decree contrary to yours, the Orators then ready to call me to the Bar, and appoint a day for my Trial, ye alſo ſenting, and by acclamations approving their Indictment: yet I choſe rather to be in danger with Law and Juſtice, than aſſent to your unjuſt votes, notwithſtanding the terror of impriſonment or death. And theſe things fell out at that time, when the City was governed by equal <hi>Democracy:</hi> but when it afterward fell under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a <hi>Few,</hi> the <hi>thirty Tyrants</hi> ſent me the fifth man to <hi>Tholus,</hi> that we ſhould bring from <hi>Salomine, Leontes, Salaminius,</hi> to be put to death, as they commanded many others alſo, to the end they might derive the envy of their [own] many crimes upon the heads of many others. Then I not by words, but actions, demonſtrated, that the fear of death (that I may ſpeak a little roughly and clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhly) touched me not: and that my grand care and concernment was, that I might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing unjuſt and impious. Nor truly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97884:43"/>
did the command and government of thoſe Tyrants, however violent and cruel, ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me, as to make me do any unjuſt act. But after we departed from <hi>Tholus,</hi> four [of the Embaſſadors] went on to <hi>Salamine,</hi> and brought away <hi>Leontes;</hi> and I went home: and perhaps I ſhould for this cauſe have been put to death, had not that Tyranny been ſoon after ſubverted and deſtroyed: and of theſe traverſes I have many witneſſes. Now whether do ye think, that I could have continued ſafe ſo many years together, if I had imployed my ſelf in matters belonging to the State: and ſo deporting my ſelf, as became a good man, had vindicated and maintained juſt cauſes, and thereunto ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſtudiouſly devoted all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs? It had been impoſſible, <hi>Athenians;</hi> nor any men elſe. But truly through the whole courſe of my life, both publickly if I acted any thing, and privatly, I ſtill have kept to the ſame rule, never to yeild to any man, neither to other, nor to any one of theſe, whom my accuſers individuouſly call my <hi>Diſciples,</hi> in any thing contrary to right and equity. Nor have I ever been <hi>Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to any man: but if any were deſirous to hear my diſcourſes, whether he were young or old, I never denied him this; nor do I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97884:44"/>
diſpute to get money, or if mony be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſs: but with equal freedom offer my ſelf to be interrogated, to the rich and to the poor, and whoſoever pleaſes, hears my anſwers. If by theſe my anſwers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, any man hath become either ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and of good and honeſt converſation, or debaucht and vitious; tis not juſt, that I ſhould bear the blame thereof; ſeeing I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught, nor promiſed to teach any man. And if any ſhall ſay, he hath learned, or heard from me in private, any thing, that all might not with equal freedom hear: be ye moſt aſſured, he ſpeaks moſt untruly. But the reaſon why ſome are delighted with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and long converſation, ye have heard <hi>Athenians.</hi> 'Tis wholly this, as I declared; that thoſe who are admitted to my confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, are much pleaſed to hear ſuch who think themſelves to be wiſe, but are not ſo, examined and refuted; for this is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant.

my ſelf to the attainment of ſuch things, which if I had attained, I ſhould have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from them nothing of utility either to my ſelf, or to you; but made it my chief buſineſs, and conſtant labour, by addreſſing to every one, to oblige all, by the greateſt and nobleſt of benefits; namely by perſwading everyman of you to make it his firſt care to become virtuous and prudent to the laſt degree; nor to take greater care about affairs belonging to the City, than the City it ſelf; and that by the ſame reaſon, care was to be taken of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the ſame manner. What therefore is it, that I, being ſuch a man, have deſerved to ſuffer? Some great good certainly, <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> if ye eſtimate things according to the dignity, verity, and nature of them, and return a juſt reward. And in truth there is due to me ſuch a good, as may be ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and convenient to my perſon. And what is convenient to a man poor and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefic, who gives himſelf wholly up to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing and urging you on to virtue, and therefore hath need to be exempted from other buſineſſes, that he may freely and without diſtractions attend that good work? Nothing doubtleſs is more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, <hi>Athenians,</hi> than that he be nouriſhed

When if ye had among ye a Law, ſuch as is in force among other Nations, concerning giving ſentence of

death, that the ſpace of not only one, but very many daies, ſhould intercede betwixt the hearing of the cauſe, and pronouncing of Judgment in cauſes capital: doubtleſs ye would approve of my reaſons and plea: but now in ſo ſhort a time 'tis not poſſible to waſh off the accuſations of ſo great crimes.</p>

                  </note> not to do injury to any, I am very far from doing it to my ſelf; that is, from pronouncing my ſelf guilty of this evil, and aſſigning to my ſelf ſome other puniſhment in lieu thereof. What? ſhall I, as if I feared to ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to which <hi>Melitus</hi> adjudgeth me, (which I profeſs not to know whether it be good or evil) chooſe inſtead thereof that which I certainly know to be evil, &amp; adjudg and condemn my ſelf to ſuffer it? <hi>Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> To what end ſhould I live in priſon, perpetually in ſlavery to the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Eleven?</hi> A <hi>pecuniary mulct?</hi> and remain in priſon until I have paid it? But, as I even now told ye, I have not mony where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pay a fine. Shall I ſuffer <hi>Exile?</hi> for to this puniſhment ye will perhaps addict me. Certainly I were much in love with life, <hi>Athenians,</hi> were I ſo inconſiderate, as not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97884:50"/>
to be able to ſee, that if ye my Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens cannot endure the way of my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and diſcourſes, but think them ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and hateful to ye, that now ye ſeek to be freed from them; others will leſs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure them. I am far from this, <hi>Athenians.</hi> Wiſely ſhould I order my life indeed, if at this age departing from my City, and wandring to and fro in baniſhment through various Countries, I ſhould prolong a miſerable life. So certainly the caſe ſtands; whereſoever I ſhall come, young men will hear me diſcourſing, as here they do. If I repel them, they will on the other ſide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel me, and bring their Elders to do ſo too: if I not repel them, their Parents and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred will for their ſakes expel me. Some man will ſay perhaps, what? <hi>Socrates; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expulſed the City, canſt thou not live ſilent and quiet?</hi> What I ſhall ſay, is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as hardly to be inſinuated into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ſome of ye; for if I tell ye, that for me to be ſilent, is <hi>to reſiſt God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not poſſible I ſhould live in quiet; ye will not believe me, as if diſſembling the matter in jeſt. But if I ſay this alſo; that it is the ſupreme happineſs of man-kind, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcourſe of virtue, and of thoſe other [excellent] things, concerning which ye
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97884:50"/>
hear me diſputing, and examining both my ſelf and others, (for without ſuch ſcrutiny and examination, life is not life) ye wil not give credit to me; and yet theſe are moſt certain truths, <hi>Athenians;</hi> though ſuch as cannot eaſily be wrought into your belief. And with the ſame difficulty truly am I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to pronounce my ſelf worthy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny puniſhment. For if I had monies by me, I would condemn my ſelf in ſuch a fine, as I ſhould be able to pay (for that I ſhould account no detriment to me) but I have no mony: unleſs ye ſhould proportion my fine to my ability; perhaps I ſhould make a ſhift to pay down a <hi>mina</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Mina Attica</hi> of ſilver, conteined 25 <hi>ſicles;</hi> and the <hi>ſicle</hi> conteined half an ounce; ſo that 12 ounces &amp; half make a <hi>mina:</hi> a ſum equal to 25 <hi>ſtaters,</hi> or <hi>Belgic Florens,</hi> each of 20 <hi>ſtufers.</hi>
                  </note> of ſilver; and therefore I fine my ſelf at that rate. <hi>Plato</hi> here, <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Crito,</hi> and <hi>Critobulus,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollodorus</hi> bid me offer the price of thirty <hi>minae;</hi> and promiſe to be ſureties for the paiment thereof. This ſum therefore I propoſe for my redemption, and they will be aſſiduous and competent ſureties for the paiment of it.</p>
               <p>But now, <hi>Athenians,</hi> ye ſhall ere-long ſuffer ignominy and reproach, brought upon your City by thoſe who deſire to defame

it;<note place="margin">He freely reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the <hi>Athenians</hi> with their <hi>ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and <hi>inhumanity</hi> towards him.</note> namely that ye have murdered <hi>Socrates,</hi> a wiſe man. For tho I be far from a wiſe man, yet they who ſeek to caſt this diſgrace upon ye, will ſay I am one. Would ye have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but a little time, I ſhould have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this your infamy, by dying of my ſelf by the courſe of nature; for ye ſee my age, how far it is from [poſſibility of long] life, how nearly approaching to death. Theſe things I ſay, not to all of ye, but to thoſe only who have by their Suffrages doomed me to death: and to thoſe I again and again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the ſame. Ye think perhaps, <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that I have loſt my cauſe for want of words,<note n="*" place="margin">And rejoyceth in the Juſtice of his <hi>cauſe,</hi> and of his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe.</hi>

I have loſt my cauſe indeed for want, not of words, but of boldneſs and impudence, and that I was unwilling to ſpeak things that would have been moſt grateful and pleaſant to your ears: in particular, that ye might hear me wailing, and howling, and doing and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I think highly unworthy of me;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97884:51"/>
ſuch as ye are accuſtomed to hear from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But I even then thought, I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do nothing indecent and diſhoneſt, in order to my evaſion from danger: nor doth it now repent me, that I made my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe in that manner. Nay I had rather die, having made my defenſe in this manner, than live by making it in that, [abjectly and poorly.] For neither in Judgement, nor in War,<note place="margin">An honorable death is to be preferred to a diſhonorable life.</note> ought any man to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid death by any way or means whatſoever; for in many Battels this is clearly evident, that death may be eaſily avoided, if a man, throwing away his arms, caſt himſelf a ſuppliant at the feet of the victorious and purſuing enemy, and begg his life. There are alſo very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other arts and ſhifts of declining danger in all occurrents, and of avoiding of death; if a man will adventure to ſay and do any thing, [however indecent and diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.] To avoid death, is not difficult, <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi> but 'tis very difficult indeed, to avoid improbity, which runs on ſwifter than death. And now truly I, old and ſlow, am catcht by one that is ſlower [by <hi>death:</hi>] but my accuſers, who are vehement and fierce, are overtaken by that which is ſwifter, by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probity.</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:97884:52"/>
And now I go away, by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to ſuffer the penalty of death: but theſe men are by truth it ſelf condemned in the mulct of improbity and injuſtice. I ſtand to the puniſhment appointed for me: and they ſtand to theirs. And theſe things ought ſo to be; and they have, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſucceeded conveniently and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely.</p>

                  </note> I deſire to fore-tel you, as by Oracle, the calamities that ſhall come upon ye: for I am now arrived at that [criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal] time, wherein men are moſt able in the faculty of Divining things to come; namely when they are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I ſay then, O ye men, whoſoever ſhall put me to death, that ſoon after my death, puniſhments ſhall overtake ye, much more grievous than the death ye inflict upon me: for thereby ye now deſign to free your ſelves from the labour of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an account of your life: but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſhall be altogether contrary to your expectation, as I affirm. There ſhall riſe up to reprove ye, many, whom hitherto I have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97884:52"/>
repreſſed, nor have ye felt them: and they ſhall ſo much the more ſeverely rebuke ye, by how much the younger ye are; and ye ſhall be vehemently offended even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. For if ye think, by killing men, to reſtrain and keep under thoſe, who are minded to upbraid and convince ye, that ye take a wrong courſe to prevent that trouble; and to reproach ye for your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt life: ye are groſly miſtaken. For that way of freeing your ſelves, is neither ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently efficacious, nor honeſt: but the beſt, moſt honorable, and eaſieſt way is this; not to hinder others, but to render your ſelves virtuous to the higheſt degree. Having then thus propheſied to thoſe who have condemned me, I leave them.</p>

To you who are my Friends, I will declare, what is the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97884:53"/>
ſignification of this my diſaſter. For, <hi>Judges,</hi> (and in calling ye <hi>Judges,</hi> I do ye but right) there hath hapned to me an accident well worthy admiration. That preſaging and prophetie <hi>Voice</hi> of my <hi>Daemonium,</hi> frequent to me at ſeveral times of my life paſt, was wont to check and countermand me, even in things of the leaſt moment, if I were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to enterpriſe any affair imprudently: but now theſe Occurrents, which ye ſee, have hapned unto me, which any one might imagine to be evils in extremity: and yet that <hi>ſign of God</hi> hath not contradicted me, neither in the morning when I came forth, nor when I aſcended into the Pulpit [or pleading chair] nor in my ſpeech, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I was delivering. In other ſpeeches, it did often interrupt me: but now in this action, it no waies oppoſed me in any thing I ſaid or did. And what do I conceive to be the reaſon of this? I will explain it to ye. This event [of my condemnation] is very happy to me. We are not juſt Eſtimators of things, whoever of us think death to be an evil. Hereof, this hath been to me a great argument; for doubtleſs that uſual <hi>ſign</hi> would have reſiſted me, if I had gone about any thing but what was truly good. Thus we may with certain judgment deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97884:53"/>
of the matter.<note place="margin">That to <hi>good</hi> men, there can be nothing of evil in death; he proves by this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</hi> Either all ſenſe is extinguiſhed by death; or mens Souls remain after death.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97884:54"/>
greateſt of Kings, would find ſuch nights to be eaſily numerable, in compariſon of other whether daies or nights. If then death be but like ſuch a ſound and undiſturbed ſleep, I call it <hi>gain</hi> or advantage: for all time ſeems to be nothing more than one night. But if it be true (as [wiſe] men have affirmed and taught) that <hi>death</hi> is a <hi>paſſing</hi> hence into thoſe places or regions, which the deceaſed inhabit: 'tis more happy for thee, when thou ſhalt have eſcaped from thoſe who will have themſelves to be accounted Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to come to thoſe who are rightly called Judges, and who are ſaid there to ſit in judgment, <hi>Minos,</hi> and <hi>Radamanthus,</hi> and <hi>Aeacus,</hi> and <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> and all other <hi>Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods,</hi> who lived juſtly and with faith.

Then to converſe with <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and <hi>Muſaeus,</hi> and <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Homer;</hi> who of us would not prefer ſuch a ſtate of life to that of this? For my part, I would die, if it were poſſible, many times over, to find the ſatisfactions I ſpeak of.

but this will be moſt pleaſant, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to find one who examines and tries every one who is wiſe; and who thinks himſelf wiſe, but is not ſo: how much rather, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, will a man find out him, who brought a numerous Army againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> or <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Contents</hi> thereof are partly <hi>moral;</hi> in that it teaches the contempt of death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant adherence to virtue; partly <hi>Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> or <hi>Theological;</hi> for that it treats of the excellency of the Soul, and of God.

               <p>Of theſe ſo various parts, the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> or Order is conciſely this. Some Philoſophers, Friends to <hi>Socrates,</hi> viſiting him in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the last day of his life, and talking fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97884:58"/>
together: the clue of their conference oon leads them to this uſeful queſtion; <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wiſe man ought to fear death?</hi> Of this, <hi>Socrates</hi> first diſputing with leſs cogent Reaſons, and tranſiently determining that other doubt, <hi>Whether it be lawful for a man to kill himſelf?</hi> opportunely, and after his grave way of arguing, reſumes &amp; proceeds in the former enquiry about deſpiſing death. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the ſumme of his reaſoning is this. Since the principal duty of a Philoſopher is, daily <hi>to meditate upon Death,</hi> i. e. to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and divide his Mind or Soul from his body, and the exorbitant deſires thereof, (and death is defined to be only a ſeparation of the Soul from the Body) and that after this frail and mortal life is at an end, there remains a full and ſolid felicity to be enjoyed by thoſe who have here truly and ſincerly embraced the study of Wiſdom: there is no reaſon why he ſhould fear death, but good cauſe rather why he ſhould wiſh and long for it: becauſe being thereby freed and ſecured from all importune and inſatiable lusts of the body, wherewith the Soul is here intangled and fettered; he ſhould inſtantly paſs to a ſecond and better life, and therein attain to a full and perfect knowledg of Wiſdom. Which he now remonſtrates, he moſt aſſuredly expected to enjoy immediatly after
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97884:58"/>
his death, and ſo, his body being diſſolved, to become conſummately happy: So from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this concluſion, there naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth a <hi>new</hi> diſpute, about the Souls ſurviving the Body. For, if the Soul exist not after death, all diſſertation concerning future feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or infelicity, muſt be vain and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
               <p>Of this moſt important conference about the immortality of the Soul, there are <hi>three</hi> parts: <hi>One</hi> poſitively aſſerts the Soul to be eſsentially immortal: the <hi>Second</hi> refutes the contrary opinions: the <hi>Third</hi> teaches the uſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the belief of the Souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
               <p>The FIRST part then of this excellent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> (and of <hi>Socrates</hi> too, from whom he ſeems to have learned it) concerning the Souls immortality, is <hi>Apodictical</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative.</hi> And yet he ſo prudently and circumſpectly manages his forces, as to begin the combat with a Forlorn of lighter Reaſons; and then bring up as it were a phalanx of stronger and more preſſing arguments, to aſſure the Victory: which indeed is his proper and peculiar method of convincing. His <hi>lighter</hi> Reaſons he advances, partly from the Doctrine of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> of the tranſmigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls into new bodies, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  </gap>] <hi>Tranſcorporation:</hi> partly from his private conceipt, that knowledge is but <hi>memory,</hi> and to <hi>learn</hi> only to <hi>remember.</hi> From theſe opinions (I ſay) conjoyn'd into one complex argument, he concludes, <hi>firſt</hi> that the Soul was existent by it ſelf, before it came to be gueſt or inmate to the body; and then <hi>that</hi> the ſame will exist alſo apart, when ſeparated from that its Lodging or Inne, and is therefore immortal. His more <hi>ſolid</hi> and Nervous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, by which he more accurately and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly demonſtrates the Souls eternal ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, are drawn from the very eſſence of the Soul it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that being <hi>ſimple</hi> or void of compoſition, it muſt by neceſſary conſequence be alſo <hi>indiſſoluble</hi> or incapable of deſtruction. For, preſuming it to be made after the <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar</hi> or Image of <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Simple, Pure, Immutable, Inviſible:</hi> he thence infers, that the Soul is [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] congenial and homogenial to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> likewiſe uncompound, inviſible, immortal: in fine, that it is <hi>(ſuo tamen modo)</hi> of the ſame nature with the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being,</hi> which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <hi>God.</hi> Hence he concludes, that though the Soul, while obliged to ſojourn in the Body, be neceſſitated to uſe the miniſtry and ſervice of its various Organs; and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97884:59"/>
ſo be neerly affected with the paſſions and other alterations incident thereunto, by reaſon of the cloſe conjunction betwixt them: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, upon the diſſolution of that ligue or conjunction, it doth inſtantly fly away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that its primary and cognate <hi>Idea, God:</hi> in the mean time still conſerving its own ſimple, incorruptible nature. And this is the ſubſtance of the <hi>firſt</hi> part of this ſublime diſpute.</p>
               <p>The SECOND is a <hi>Refutation</hi> of Opinions impugning the immortality of the Soul: which are chiefly two; <hi>One,</hi> that affirms the Soul to be an <hi>Harmony,</hi> that is originally compoſed, and reſulting from the conformation and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of the corporeal ſenſes: and therefore as it hath its beginning from, ſo it must alſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together with the body. <hi>Another,</hi> which allows the Soul to be indeed more laſting than the Body, and ſo to ſurvive it; yet will not have it to be indiſſoluble, but to decay by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and at length utterly to periſh, from its own natural weakneſs. This <hi>laſt</hi> Error <hi>Plato,</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Socrates,</hi> ſolidly refutes; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alledging, that the Immortality of the Soul is clearly manifeſt even from the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cauſes, i. e.</hi> of a <hi>Primary</hi> cauſe, namely <hi>God;</hi> and of <hi>Second</hi> or proxim cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by right reaſon duly inveſtigated. Where
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97884:60"/>
he opportunely evinceth it to be highly unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſo to acquieſce in the re-ſearch of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, as to relinquiſh the first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal: and then proceeds to teach, that there are two kindes of Cauſes; one, <hi>principal, or Supreme,</hi> and in truth cauſe of all Cauſes, which gave both being and efficacy to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Others, <hi>Secondary,</hi> which are not truly [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] Cauſes, but only [<gap reason="foreign">

From the Reaſons therefore of theſe different Cauſes, <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> infers the Soul to be immortal. Whence by a genuine tranſition, he proceeds to the</p>
               <p>THIRD part of the Diſputation or Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which concerns the <hi>ſtate</hi> or condition of the Soul, after this ſhaddow of life is vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or (as he ſaith) <hi>apud inferos;</hi> thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] a <hi>ſecond</hi> Life, whereof he treats more amply <hi>in Timaeo;</hi> in this arguing thus. Seeing that in this tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life, there every day ariſe infinite diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Humane affairs, and events apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with Equity and Juſtice; ſo that good and pious men ſuffer various affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and oppreſſions; and on the contrary, unrighteous and impious men flouriſh in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97884:60"/>
and proſperity: reaſon requires, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſcene of Inequality is withdrawn, after this Life (the uſe whereof is in common to all men, both good and evil) is expired, there ſhould ſucceed <hi>another,</hi> wherein is to be made a just distinction of the good from the bad, that ſo theſe may be adjudged to condign puniſhment, and thoſe rewarded with felicity, according to their deſerts. And hence he collects, that there are but two paths wherein all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals walk: <hi>One</hi> leading to eternal <hi>happineſs,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> to endleſs <hi>miſery.</hi> Thus much this our wiſe <hi>Ethnic</hi> plainly diſcerned by the meer light of nature, by right reaſon: more he could not perceive without rayes of light ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. We are not therefore to arraign him of ignorance, but rather to applaud his ſingular modesty, in that in the cloſe of his diſcourſe about rewards and puniſhments after death, he adventures upon no conjectural deſcriptions of the places, qualities, degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of either: but leaving all ſuch to <hi>Poets,</hi> ingeniouſly profeſſeth, he thought it not to be the part of a man endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſound Judgment, to affirm any thing concerning thoſe inſcrutable ſecrets, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of Divine Juſtice. Only he held it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the minds of men be deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with eſtabliſhed and certain perſwaſions of rewards and puniſhments to come: that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97884:61"/>
ſo they may be inflamed with love of Virtue, which he defines to be the true and only way to future felicity; and reclaimed from Vice, the high way to future infelicity. And this he declares to be the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of his Doctrine of the Souls immortality: namely, that we may be induced to learn, and aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fellow the way that leads to that happy life; and carefully avoid that of miſery. The <hi>former</hi> he defines to be true and ſolid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> the Noblest part whereof is this, that Divorcing and Alienating our mind from all commerce with corporeal affections, and ſenſual pleaſures; we fix it intirely upon the contemplation of <hi>God,</hi> and hold it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually exerciſed in that Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This being the great duty of man, and moſt ſatisfactory imployment of a Reaſonable Soul; he opportunely admoniſheth every one, to make it alſo his principal care and ſtudy, to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently converſant therein: alwaies animating himſelf with this nobleſt of hopes, that after the ſhort and anxious race of this life is finiſhed, he ſhall infallibly attain unto that immortal Happineſs, of which he hath now diſcourſed.

                  <p>Truly being then preſent, I was affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a very ſtrange manner: For <hi>commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration</hi> moved me not at all, as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the death of a man nearly Related to me: For to me he ſeemed happy, <hi>Eche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> both by his deportment, and by his ſerene conformity, and alſo by his diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: ſo undauntedly and bravely he ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death, that it then came into my mind that he deſcended not to the ſhades below, without ſome Divine power, and therefore would when he came thither, live in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if ever any man elſe did. I did not then much <hi>pitty</hi> him, as became one that was ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of ſo ſad and doleful a Tragedy: nor was I on the other ſide ſenſible of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,

wherewith we were wont to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, when we were ſeriouſly imployed in Philoſophical conferences, though at that very time alſo we were earneſtly occupied in ſuch: but was variouſly agitated by a diſagreeable and contrary paſſion. A certain unuſual pleaſure mixt with grief, ſurpriſed me, thinking he was ſo ſoon to die.

                  <p>I will endeavour to recount to ye all that paſſed from firſt to laſt. In the daies precedent, I and ſome others were wont to viſit <hi>Socrates</hi> frequently: meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther early in the morning, in the Judgment Hall, where his cauſe had been tried, for it ſtood next to the priſon. There we daily expected, until the priſon doors were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; paſſing the time in walking and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the while, for 'twas pretty late before the priſon was opened. When the doors were unlocked, we went in to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and many times paſſed the whole day with him. On the day of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we came to viſit him earlier than we uſed: for the day before, when we retired from the priſon in the evening, we had heard, that the ſacred ſhip was arrived from <hi>Delos:</hi> and thereupon agreed among our ſelves to come to <hi>Socrates</hi> ſooner than our cuſtom was, and indeed we did ſo: but the Door-keeper, who formerly uſed to obey
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97884:65"/>
us, came forth, and bid us have patience a while, nor to enter till he called us. For now (ſaith he) the Eleven Officers are taking off <hi>Socrates</hi> his Fetters, having commanded that he Die this day. So after a ſhort ſtay, he returned, and gave us admittance: Being entred, we found <hi>Socrates</hi> unfettered, and <hi>Xantippe</hi> (whom you know) holding an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in her arms, and ſitting by <hi>Socrates.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen, and ſaluted us, and ſaid ſome ſuch things as Women uſe to ſpeak [out of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility] now <hi>Socrates,</hi> ſaith ſhe, this is the laſt time your Friends ſhall ſpeak to you, and you to them: and he turning his eyes upon <hi>Crito,</hi> I deſire <hi>Crito,</hi> ſaid he, that one of you would lead away this Woman into ſome other place. Her therefore weeping and lamenting, the Servants of <hi>Crito</hi> led away. But <hi>Socrates</hi> ſitting upon a little Bed, with one legg reſting upon his other thigh, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his legg, ſaying the while; how abſurd dos that ſeem, which men call pleaſant!<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Socrates,</hi> upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he felt in his leggs, ſoon after his Fetters had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, reflects upon the affinity betwixt <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> and their viciſſitude; intimating, that the condition of human life is ſuch, as to be led in a round of pleaſure and pain <hi>alternately</hi> ſucceeding.</note> and how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſtrange is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of whats unpleaſant, ſo as to be perceived contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97884:65"/>
to what's pleaſant! ſo that nature would not have a man affected with both at once; but if any man purſue, and take one of them, he is compelled for the moſt part to take the other alſo; as if they were both fitly contained in one head; and I believe that <hi>Aeſop,</hi> if he had taken notice of the thing, would have compoſed a Fable of it, namely, that God, when he attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe two Enemies, <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> making War each againſt other, but could not effect it, bound their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that where either comes, the other alſo muſt follow, as ſeemed to me even now; for while my Fetters were upon my leggs, I had pain there, and the pain vaniſhing away upon the remove of my Fetters, pleaſure ſeems immediatly to ſucceed it. And you have opportunely put me in mind of this, anſwered <hi>Cebes,</hi> by <hi>Jove, Socrates;</hi> for a good while ſince many have asked me, and <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> lately, concerning the Poems you have of late made, particularly the Fables of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> you have turned into Verſes, and a Hymn to <hi>Apollo:</hi> for what reaſon you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thoſe Poems, ſince you came into this place, when you never before addicted your ſelf to Poetry. If therefore you will have me give an anſwer to <hi>Evenus,</hi> when he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97884:66"/>
ſhall again interrogate me (as I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he will) tell me, I pray, what anſwer I ſhall make to him. Tell him, replies <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>

And I thought what I did in the paſt time of my life, to be the very thing that my Dream commanded, and by reiterated Injunctions urged: and as they who by repeated ſhouts incite men running a race, ſo I thought my Dream did the ſame to me, by frequent admonitions
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97884:66"/>
inculcating its command, that I ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to <hi>Muſic;</hi> for as much as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is the nobleſt and moſt excellent <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic.</hi> While I did this, and ſentence of death had now been pronounced againſt me, and the Feaſt of <hi>Apollo</hi> forbad me to die: I thought fit by no means to diſobey the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of my Dream, even though I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it to concern the <hi>vulgar</hi> Muſic: but to do according to the preſcript thereof. For I thought it ſafer, not to depart from hence, before I had in that manner alſo, to ſome degree performed my Vow; obeying my Dream, by making Verſes. The firſt Poem I made therefore, was to that God whoſe Feaſt this was.<note n="*" place="margin">The beginning of this <hi>Hymn. Diogen. Laertius</hi> recites, in <hi>vita Socrat.</hi>

                     </note> I would have you report to <hi>Evenus:</hi> and wiſh him health, bidding
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97884:67"/>
him, if he be wiſe, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; for I go hence, as I think, this very day, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſo commanding. Here <hi>Simmias</hi> interrupts him, ſaying, what advice is that, <hi>Socrates,</hi> you give to <hi>Evenus?</hi> I have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him a long time; but as much as I can fore-ſee, he will not be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forward to follow your counſel in this particular. What, ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> is not <hi>Evenus</hi> a Philoſopher? He ſeems to be one, replies <hi>Simmias:</hi> and therefore ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> he &amp; whoever elſe embraceth the ſtudy of Philoſophy, as he ought, will not decline death, and yet will not think himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to lay violent hands upon himſelf; for this they ſay, is no waies lawful. And ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he let down his leggs from the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bed to the ground, and ſitting in that poſture, purſued the remainder of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. <hi>Cebes</hi> asked him then, what ſay you, <hi>Socrates?</hi> that it is a crime for a man to lay violent hands upon himſelf; and yet
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97884:67"/>
that a Philoſopher is willing to follow him who dies? To whom <hi>Socrates;</hi> what, <hi>Cebes?</hi> have ye, you and <hi>Simmias,</hi> heard nothing concerning theſe matters, after ſo familiar converſation with <hi>Philolaus?</hi> Nothing, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> I aſſure you.

Now as for what they ſay, that it is criminal to kill ones ſelf; that indeed I have long ſince heard, not only from <hi>Philolaus</hi> (as you asked me) when he lived among us, but from ſome others alſo, that it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious act: but why it ſhould be ſuch, I have underſtood nothing of certainty from any.<note place="margin">The <hi>firſt</hi> queſtion, <hi>Whether ſelf-murder be criminal,</hi> or not; argued <hi>Socratically,</hi> that is <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> and then determined by theſe two fundamental reaſons; <hi>God takes care of us;</hi> and <hi>we are his by right of poſſeſſion;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tis double impiety to lay violent hands upon our ſelves.</note> But be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage [replies <hi>Socrates</hi>] per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you ſhall hear the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by and by.

this perchance may ſeem ſtrange, that this among other things ſhould be univerſally true, without exception; that no calamity can befal a man ſo great and intollerable, as that it may be better for him to die, than to live: and to men in ſuch a caſe, is it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to affirm, that it is impiety in them, rather to confer this benefit upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than to expect it from the hand of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?

But a prudent and circumſpect man will rather deſire to continue ſtill in that which is more advantageous and profitable to him; which certainly, <hi>Socrates,</hi> ſeems plainly repugnant to thoſe things that have been by us juſt now explicated; and yet it appears to be more like truth, that wiſe men when they die, ought to be troubled; and fools to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.

This we affirm to be truth. For this body creates to us an infinity of buſineſſes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and diſquiets, meerly for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and neceſſary ſupplies of it. Beſides, if diſeaſes chance to invade us, they likewiſe hinder us from the inveſtigation of various things: and that fills us with loves, deſires, fears, various imaginations and Chimera's,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97884:74"/>
and many fooliſh whimſies; ſo that it is a very true ſaying, that <hi>the body will never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to be wiſe.</hi> For nothing but the body raiſeth wars, ſeditions, combats, and the like miſchiefs, by its inordinate luſts: and we are forced to provide monies for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the body, being ſlaves and drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the neceſſary ſervices of it. Now while we are thus imployed in theſe meaner Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we have no leiſure to apply our ſelves to the ſtudy and ſearch of wiſdom. And what is the greateſt of all incommodities, if we do by chance get any thing of leiſure and vacancy from the cares of the body, and addreſs our minds to the ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing; preſently the body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes, and while we are buſied in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, raiſeth commotions and tumult, and ſo diſturbs and confounds the mind, that it cannot poſſibly diſcern truth. But we have already demonſtrated,<note place="margin">The former aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repeated, and illuſtrated by a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</hi> Whence flows a certain <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;</hi> ſince the grand deſign of a Philoſopher is, to diſcern truth, his duty is to ſeparate his Soul from his Body; and ſo as it were to anticipate death in this life.</note> that if we deſire to perceive any thing purely and clearly, we muſt withdraw from the body, and imploy only our mind, which alone is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97884:74"/>
capable to diſcern the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Objects, in the contemplation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for then at length, as appears, we ſhall attain to the fruition of what we deſire, and with love and diligence ſeek after, namely <hi>wiſdom;</hi> when we have paſſed through the [refinement] of death, as our precedent diſcourſe intimates: but not whilſt we remain in this life. For if it be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to perceive any thing pure and intire, in conjunction with the body, one of theſe two [propoſitions] muſt of neceſſity follow: <hi>either we ſhall never attain to ſapience; or not until we have paſſed out of this life.</hi> For then will the Soul be intirely divorced and ſeparate from the Body, but not before. While we live here, we approach indeed never to ſapience, if we have as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and converſation with the body, and be as little infected with the luſts thereof, as the condition and neceſſities of our frail nature will permit: but preſerve our ſelves pure from the contagion of the ſame, until God himſelf ſhall diſcharge and free us wholly from it. And being once thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and pure from the madneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of the body; as is reaſonable to believe, we ſhall both be aſſociated to the like pure beings, and by our ſelves know
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97884:75"/>
all purity and integrity; which perhaps is <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf. For <hi>it is not poſſible for him who is himſelf impure, to touch what is pure.</hi> Theſe things, <hi>Simmias,</hi> I conceive it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all, who are poſſeſſed with a right deſire of underſtanding things, both to hold, and to diſcourſe of among themſelves.

                     </note> that who ſhall arrive at the place whither I am now going, will there, if any where, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly attain to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that, for which we have in the whole courſe of our life paſt, been ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with extreme labour and ſtudy. This peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore now appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, is finiſhed with good hope; and ſo it will to any other, who ſhall have once perſwaded himſelf, to prepare his mind, by rendring it pure and clean. <hi>No doubt of it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Simmias.</hi> Is therefore what we ſaid even now, to be held a purification and purging of the Mind; <hi>viz.</hi> as much as is poſſible, to divorce it from the Body, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97884:75"/>
to accuſtom it to be by it ſelf congregated and retired from the ſame, and to dwell as it were by it ſelf: both in this, and in the future life, ſingle by it ſelf, and freed as from the chains of the body? <hi>Yea certainly,</hi> ſaith <hi>Simmias;</hi> Is death then rightly called a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and ſeparation of the Soul from the Body? <hi>It is ſo,</hi> ſaith he. And do they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who ſtudy Philoſophy rightly, moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to divorce their Souls from their Bodies, as we have ſaid? is not this the conſtant meditation of Philoſophers? <hi>It ſeems to be ſo.</hi> What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſaid in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">A <hi>third</hi> concluſion.

Tho we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that to be impoſſible: yet the like affection falls upon them, in that their ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and fooliſh temperance; for while they fear to be deprived of ſome pleaſures, and ſtill coveting them, abſtain from others; they are carried away by thoſe they covet, without reſtraint.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97884:77"/>
of pleaſures: and 'tis their caſe, to be overcome by ſome pleaſures, whilſt they conquer others. So that what we ſaid even now of vulgar Fortitude, holds true alſo of theſe men, that they are Temperate from ſome Intemperance. But, my <hi>Simmias,</hi>

not reflecting again to the firſt, nor making a return or regreſs: aſſure your ſelf, it would come to paſs, that at length all things would have the ſame figure, be in the ſame manner affected, and conſequently would ceaſe to be made. <hi>How's that?</hi> ſaith he. 'Tis not difficult, anſwers <hi>Socrates,</hi> to comprehend what I ſay. For Example; if this very thing, <hi>to ſleep</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) that is ſleep, were exiſtent; but to <hi>awake,</hi> were not, on the reverſe, compoſed of the man ſleeping: we were obliged to conclude, that all would at length repreſent the Fable of <hi>Endymion,</hi> and appear no where; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame would happen to all, that hapned to that <hi>Endymion,</hi> namely to <hi>ſleep.</hi> And if all things were mixed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded into one, without diſcretion or diſtinction; then that of the <hi>Anaxagoreans</hi> would come to paſs, all things would be at once.

I hold nothing ſo certain and evident, as that all theſe are, and chiefly both Beautiful and Good, and the reſt of which you now treated: and I am abundantly convinced of their verity. What? and is <hi>Cebes</hi> ſo too? for he alſo ought to be perſwaded. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſaith <hi>Simmias,</hi> the whole matter hath been ſufficiently proved to him too, tho he be a man of moſt hard and moſt ſlow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, beyond all others; yet I think, it hath been clearly enough demonſtrated to him, that our Souls were pre-exiſtent to our Nativity. But whether they alſo <hi>ſurvive</hi> our death, and continue their <hi>Being</hi> after the diſſolution of our Bodies; this I think hath not been yet demonſtrated: and that vulgar opinion, which <hi>Cebes</hi> mentioned, yet remains unrefuted; namely that ſo ſoon as a man is dead, his Mind or Soul is diſperſed, and deſtroyed, ſo that it can no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt. For what ſhould hinder, but it may derive its origin and creation from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle, and have Being long before it enter into a human body: but when it departs, and is freed again from the body, then it both die, and be utterly aboliſhed?

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97884:89"/>
were, before we were born. There remains to be remonſtrated the <hi>other</hi> part, that the demonſtration may be full and perfect; namely that after our death, our Souls will be, no leſs than they were before our birth.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97884:97"/>
men ſtudious of Diſcipline know that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, when it hath found their Mind or Soul ſo diſpoſed, is verſed chiefly in this, by degrees to mitigate and compoſe [the Soul] and to deliver it [from thoſe Fetters;] teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that that conſideration which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſervice of the eyes, is full of error; and that the information of the Ears and all other ſenſes, is likewiſe full of error, perſwading it to retire from them, and not to uſe them, unleſs when neceſſity compels: and declaring and exhorting it, to recollect and congregate it ſelf; and to give credit to none but it ſelf, ſeeing that it ſelf alone can by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

For, that it is conſtrained to agree with the Body in opinions, and to be delighted at the ſame time with it (as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97884:98"/>

But as for what things are ſaid concerning them, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them with every reaſon, and all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of arguments alledged, or wholly to reject them, and to leap back from them, before you have endeavoured with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible contention and equity of mind, even to the laſt effort, and to wearineſs, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97884:101"/>
them: this I think to be the part of an effeminate and incurious ſpirit. And herein, this one thing is to be ſtudiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, that either we may learn, or find out how theſe things are; or if that cannot be done, chooſing and fixing upon ſuch a reaſon, among thoſe that occur to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding, as may be more firm and convincing, <hi>i. e.</hi> as may be leſs ſubject to refutation; ſet up our reſt therein: that being thereby, as by a ſhip, carried ſafely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, we may eſcape the dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of this life; unleſs any can be waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tranſmitted over in ſome firmer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome <hi>Divine Word.</hi> Truly I ſhall not be aſhamed to ask, ſince you ſay this: nor will be a cauſe of accuſing my ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that I had not ingeniouſly explained to you what my opinion is concerning this matter.

Perhaps, ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> this is your opinion: but tell me freely, how far, and wherein my diſcourſe fails of being perſwaſive. <hi>Thus far,</hi> ſaith he:<note n="*" place="bottom">The firſt <hi>contrary</hi> Opinion, that the Soul is <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Concent;</hi> and ſo both reſults from, and periſhes with the Body.</note> that any man may ſay the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97884:101"/>
ſame, with equal reaſon, both of <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and of a <hi>Harp,</hi> and of other inſtruments of Muſic: namely that <hi>Harmony</hi> is a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>inviſible,</hi> and <hi>incorporeal,</hi> and moſt <hi>beautiful,</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> in a well tuned and concordant Harp or Lute: but the Harp it ſelf, and the ſtrings, are bodies compound, and terrene, and of Kin to that <hi>Mortal</hi> [na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.] And when any one hath broken the Harp, or cut the ſtrings; if another ſhould aſſert, and by the ſame reaſon you urged, that of neceſſity that Harmony doth ſtill exiſt, and is not deſtroyed, (for it would be no difficulty at all, that the <hi>Harp</hi> is ſtill in <hi>being,</hi> and that the ſtrings being broken, are mortal; but that the Harmony, which was by community of nature, and by cognation conjoyned with that Divine and Immortal [Being] died and vaniſhed, before the Mortal,) but continue in Being ſome where; and that the wood and ſtrings would rot and fall to duſt ſooner than the Harmony decay, or ſuffer any thing of deſtruction. For truly, <hi>Socrates,</hi> I conceive that you alſo have thought our Soul to be ſomething like this [Harmony:] as if our body being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, were hold together by hot and cold, dry and moiſt; and from the mixture of theſe, reſults a certain temperature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97884:102"/>
which is the Soul; and this, after thoſe Elements or Ingredients have been exactly and in due proportions mixed and tempered together. If therefore the Soul be a kind of Harmony, namely when our Body ſhall be infinitely extended, and ſo freed from diſeaſes and other evils: that then it is abſolutely neceſſary, the Soul (how Divine ſoever) ſhould periſh, as other Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that 'are either in Sounds, or in all the works of Artificers: and there the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of every body endure a long time, until it be burned, or diſſolved by putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Obſerve then what we ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this diſcourſe, if any ſhould affirm, that the Soul is a certain temperament ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the ingredients of the body; and that in that diſſolution which is called <hi>death,</hi> it firſt periſheth. Here <hi>Socrates,</hi> after he had, as he uſed often to do, caſt his eye round about, and ſmiled; <hi>Simmias</hi> hath reaſon, ſaith he. If therefore any of ye be more copious, and better furniſhed with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than my ſelf, why doth he not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? for <hi>Simmias</hi> ſeems not lightly or raſhly to have touched that diſcourſe. Yet before I anſwer, I hold it convenient, we firſt hear <hi>Cebes,</hi> what he alſo reprehends in my diſcourſe, that gaining time for thoughts,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97884:102"/>
we may well conſider what to reply; then, that having fully underſtood their objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we may either yeild to them, or by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their impertinency, ſo defend and make good our own Doctrine. But go to, <hi>Cebes,</hi> ſaith he; declare to us what troubles you in this argument, ſo that you cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and give credit to my words.</p>
                  <p>I will tell you,<note place="margin">The <hi>Second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> opinion; that the Soul, tho more firm and laſting than the Body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: doth yet at length, after it hath animated and worm out many bodies ſucceſſively, decay, and through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs periſh; which <hi>Cebes</hi> illuſtrates by an <hi>example.</hi>
                     </note> ſaith <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes:</hi> To me your diſcourſe ſeems to be involved in the incommodity, and to be guilty of the ſame fault I obſerved before. For, that our Soul exiſted before it came into our Body, I deny not: for that hath been fairly, and (if it may be ſaid without offence) abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated. But that any thing remains to us after death, ſeems to me not ſufficiently proved: For, that the Soul is ſtronger and more laſting than the Body; I ſo hold, that I ſhall not grant that Exception of <hi>Simmias</hi> to be true; becauſe the Soul ſeems to be far more noble and excellent than all theſe. Why therefore (ſaith Reaſon it ſelf ſpeaking to me) do you yet doubt and refuſe to believe? ſince
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97884:103"/>
you ſee, that when a man is dead, what of him was more infirm and weak, yet remains: do you not conceive it to be neceſſary, that what is more firm and laſting, muſt at the ſame time remain conſerved? But now do you perpend and conſider this alſo, if I ſhall ſay any thing conſiderable: for I want as much as <hi>Simmias</hi> did (it ſeems) ſome I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or ſimilitude. For, to me theſe things ſeem to be ſpoken, juſt as if one ſhould, an old Weaver being dead, ſay thus of him; the man is not deſtroyed, but remains ſafe ſomewhere: and ſhould bring this argument for it, the garment of his own weaving wherewith he was cloathed, which is yet extant. And if another ſhould, after refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of aſſent to that argument, ask, whether of the two is more laſting, man or a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may indeed be conſumed by the very uſe of wearing: and a third ſhould anſwer, that man is much more laſting; and ſo ſhould think it demonſtrated, that that man doth by ſo much the rather remain ſafe, becauſe what is leſs laſting, hath not periſhed. This I conceive not to be ſo. Obſerve alſo what I ſay; for any one may think it to be ſaid fooliſhly and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently. For this Weaver having worn out and woven many ſuch garments, died the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97884:103"/>
laſt of theſe many, but before the laſt: and yet man is notwithſtanding neither worſe, nor more infirm, as for what concerns that matter. This very Image (I think) the Soul ſhall receive by reaſon of the Body. And he who ſhall ſay the ſame of them, may ſeem to me to ſpeak ſoberly and moderately, if he conclude the Soul to be of long durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the Body leſs firm, and of ſhorter duration. But I would ſay rather, that the Soul conſumes and wears but many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, though they all live many years. For if the Body be diſſolved and periſh, the man yet ſurviving, and the Soul alwaies weaves a new what is worn out: it will be wholly neceſſary, that the Soul at that time when it ſhall die, have the garment it laſt wove; and that it periſh before that laſt garment only. But when the Soul once dies, the Body then ſoon demonſtrates the imbecility of its nature, and quickly rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vaniſheth. Wherefore according to this reaſon, it would be highly extravagant for us to grow proud upon this perſwaſion, and to be confident, that after we are dead, our Soul doth ſtill remain ſome where. For if a man ſhall grant more than what you affirm; namely, that our Soul was pre-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent before it entred into the Body; yea that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97884:104"/>
nothing hinders but the Souls of ſome may, after they are dead, ſurvive and continue; and that they are often born, and die again, that is, they often come and go (for that ſuch is the virtue and power of the Soul, as that it conſerves it ſelf through the various moments of its birth) though, I ſay, a man ſhall grant all this, he would yet be forced to confeſs this, that the Soul doth not only endure vaſt labour in all thoſe many acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or approaches of generations; but alſo at length is by one of thoſe decenſions or diſlodgings, that is by ſome one death, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed and aboliſhed. But this death, and this diſſolution of the Body, which brings deſtruction at laſt to the Soul, let no man ſay he underſtands. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, any of us ſhould comprehend it by ſenſe. This being thus, it is abſurd for any man living, who cannot prove it, with a certain fooliſh and ignorant ſecurity to be confident, that his Soul is immortal, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from deſtruction. Beſides, 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a man drawing near to his death, to fear for his Soul, leſt in that very preſent disjunction of his Body, it utterly periſh, and be aboliſhed.</p>

himſelf, that there is nothing of integrity or ſincerity in any man. You are in the right, ſay I.

Whereof I will bring a juſt and convenient argument. So far was I amuſed and blinded by this way of conſidering, that what things I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clearly and certainly (as I my ſelf, and others alſo thought) known; that was I obliged to unlearn and forget, and to doubt of very many others alſo, and chiefly of this, why a man grows and increaſes in ſtature and ſtrength: for this I before thought to be evident to every one, that he was nouriſhed, becauſe he eat and drank: and that ſo he came to be increaſed in bulk and ſtature: and when from meats, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from fleſh, there comes an addition of fleſh, and bones are added to bones, and ſo
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97884:116"/>
in the ſame manner to all other parts their own proper nouriſhment is brought and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilated: I thought that by this means a man was increaſed, from a little tiny infant; to his full ſtature. Theſe were my thoughts then; and do you think them reaſonable and ſatisfactory? <hi>To me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cebes,</hi> they ſeem to be ſo. Now conſider alſo what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: I alſo thought the matter to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident, when a great man ſtood by a little man, that he was greater by the head; and one Horſe greater than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what's yet more evident, that ten were more than eight, becauſe two had been added to eight, and that two cubits were more than one, becauſe of double the length. <hi>And now,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cebes, what think you of theſe things?</hi> Far, by <hi>Jove,</hi> ſaith he, very far I am from thinking, that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the cauſe of them: ſo that now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie my ſelf, whether if one be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to one, the firſt one be two; or whether that which hath been added, and that to which it is added, be made two, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of one to the other: for I wonder, if when each of them was ſingle and apart, both were one, and not two; but after their growing neerer one to the other, that very coming together hath been the cauſe why
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97884:116"/>
they were made one. Nor if a man by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting divide one into two, can I yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how this cutting aſunder of one thing, hath been the cauſe why they are two: for that cauſe is then contrary to their being two: for then when they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced neerer together, and one was put to the other: and now when they are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſeparated one from the other; I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that I know, that one is made.

And now I had prepared my ſelf to enquire of him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both the Sun, and the Moon, and the reſt of the Planets and Stars; namely of their celerity and converſions, and mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and other Affections and Apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; how far it was moſt commodious for every one of them, to do and to ſuffer, what they did and ſuffered. For I did not think, that he who taught, that all things are compoſed and governed by a <hi>Mind,</hi> would allege any other cauſe of them, than this, that it was <hi>Beſt</hi> for them to be as they are. And ſo when he attributed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned a cauſe to every thing in particular, and in common to all things; I conceived he
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97884:118"/>
would not aſſign that for a cauſe to every thing in particular, namely what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and peculiarly <hi>beſt</hi> for each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing; and to all in general, what was their common and univerſal Good. Thus my hopes were great, and I pleaſed my ſelf with mighty expectations, ſuch as I would not have parted with for a very great ſum of money; and with earneſt ſtudy I took thoſe Books into my hands, and with as much ſpeed as I could, I read them quite through; that I might quickly underſtand the <hi>Best</hi> and the <hi>Worſt.</hi> But (believe me) I ſoon fell from that lofty hope: for when I had made ſome progreſs in reading thoſe Books, I perceived the man to uſe neither mind nor judgment, nor to aſſign any Cauſes to the compoſition and order of things with conveniency: but putting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Aerial and Ethererial [influences] and many other abſurd [Chimera's] for the true Cauſes of things.<note n="*" place="margin">An <hi>Example</hi> fitly remonſtrating the folly of aſſigning Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes.</note> And me thinks, the ſame fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls him, that belongs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other who ſhould ſay, Whatſoever <hi>Socrates</hi> doth, he doth with a Mind, and with judgment: and then deſigning to explicate the cauſes of the particular actions I do, ſhould further
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97884:118"/>
ſay, firſt that I ſit here, becauſe my Body conſiſts of bones and nerves; and that my bones are ſolid and firm, and have their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and intervals of joynts betwixt them; and that my nerves are ſo contrived and formed, that they may be extended and relaxed again, and environ and bind the bones together with the fleſh and skin, which contains and inveſts them. When therefore the bones are raiſed up in their joynts, the ſinews which are one while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtretch, and by and by relaxed, cauſe me to have the faculty of moving, bowing, and extending my limbs: and that by this cauſe I come to ſit bowed forwards in this poſture. And that he might explicate the cauſes of this my conference with you, ſhould affirm them to be certain words or voices formed of aire, and hearing, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite others equally remote, but ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the true and certain cauſe; namely that the <hi>Athenians</hi> having been pleaſed by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſuffrages to condemn me: I am likewiſe pleaſed to ſit here; and it ſeems more juſt, that I ſhould ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have doomed me to ſuffer.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97884:125"/>
now perhaps what I ſay, will be more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained in this manner. Ought an <hi>Odd</hi> number to have this name wherewith we now mark it, or not? <hi>Yes doubtleſs.</hi> This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of all things (for this I ask) or ſomewhat elſe, which though different from Odd, ought nevertheleſs alwaies to call it by its own name; becauſe the nature of it is ſuch as never to defect from <hi>Odd?</hi> This I ſay, is that very thing, as the number of three, and many other numbers ſuffer. Now conſider this in the number Three; are Three to be called both by their own name, <hi>Three,</hi> and by that of <hi>Odd</hi> alſo, though Odd be not the ſame with a <hi>Triad,</hi> or <hi>Ternary?</hi> But thus comparated is alſo a Ternary, and Five, and every half of a number; ſo that though it be not the ſame as <hi>Odd,</hi> yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies every one of them is <hi>Odd.</hi> Two like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and Four, and again every other Series of number, though it be not the ſame as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> yet muſt alwaies be <hi>Even.</hi> Do you grant this, or not? <hi>Why ſhould I not?</hi> ſaith he. Obſerve then ſaith he, what I deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; it is this.<note n="*" place="margin">A Third <hi>Theſis</hi> dependent on the precedents. That what admits a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary quality, is <hi>One</hi> thing; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary quality admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>another,</hi> The Contrary <hi>Subject</hi> therefore remains, while contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are variouſly induced; but ſo, that contrary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot be in the ſame mode.

whatſoever, which though they be not contrary among themſelves, yet alwaies have contraries: nor do they ſeem capable to put on that form which is contrary to the Species wherein they are: but when that contrary form once intervenes, they preſently either periſh, or give place. Shall we not ſay, that Three will ſooner pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, or ſuffer any thing elſe, than endure to be made E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cebes.</hi> And yet, ſaith he again, the number <hi>Two</hi> is not contrary to the number Three. <hi>It is not, truly.</hi> Therefore not only contrary Species admit not the acceſſion of one to another mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſome other contraries alſo abhor, and are incapable to ſuffer that mutual acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>You ſpeak with great probability,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cebes.</hi> Will you then, ſaith he, that, if we be able, we define of what quality theſe things are? <hi>With all my heart,</hi> ſaith he. Will they not be ſuch, <hi>Cebes,</hi> which ſo conform what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they poſſeſs, as not only to force it to retain its own Species of form, but alſo
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97884:126"/>
ſuffer it not to admit and put on the Species or form of any Contrary whatſoever? <hi>How ſay you to this,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cebes?</hi> As we ſaid a little before: for you know it to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that that which contains the Species of Three, is not only <hi>Three,</hi> but alſo <hi>Odd. Right.</hi> For this reaſon we ſaid, that the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies contrary to that form which makes this, can never be induced. <hi>By no means.</hi> Hath the Species of <hi>Odd</hi> perfected that form? <hi>Certainly.</hi> And is the Species of <hi>Even</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Species of <hi>Odd. It is.</hi> Therefore the ſpecies of <hi>Even</hi> ſhall never force it ſelf upon <hi>Three. Never.</hi> Are <hi>Three</hi> then free from she ration of <hi>Even? Free.</hi> Therefore tſte number <hi>Three</hi> is <hi>odd. Certainly.</hi> What therefore I undertook to define, I have now defined; namely,<note n="*" place="margin">He repeateth what he had above diſtinctly applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>viz.</hi> that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>qualities</hi> cannot be together in the ſame ſubject; but one of neceſſity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth the other.

For the number <hi>Two</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies infers a contrary to Odd, and Fire a Contrary to Cold; and the like of very many others
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97884:127"/>
But conſider whether you agree that the matter ought to be defined thus; That a Contrary doth not only not receive its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but that alſo which may adfer any contrary to that, to which it ſelf may come, namely that which adfers it, doth never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a form contrary to the form of that which is adferred. But again rub up your memory; for 'tis no incommodity to hear the ſame again. The number <hi>Five</hi> never admits the ration of <hi>Even;</hi> nor the number of <hi>Ten</hi> (the duple of five) the ration of <hi>Odd.</hi> This therfore, being it ſelf contrary to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will yet never admit the ration of <hi>Odd.</hi> Nor will that number and half that number, or half a number admit the ration of the whole, nor a third part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at leaſt if you comprehend my meaning, and aſſent unto me. <hi>I both understand your ſenſe,</hi> ſaith he, and aſſent without the leaſt doubt or ſcruple.</p>

To him that ſhould thus argue, we could not (I confeſs) deny, but that Odd may periſh; for Odd it ſelf is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all deſtruction: Since, if that were not agreed upon among us, we might eaſily evince, that when Even comes in place, Odd and the Ternary inſtantly fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and ſo we might firmly determine of fire and hot, and the reſt.

if the Soul be immortal, we are highly concerned to take care of it, not only in reſpect of this ſhort time, which we define by the name of life, but of Eternity that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after this life: and the danger now ſeems to be great, if any man ſhall neglect his Soul. For if Death be a ſeparation and diſſolution of the whole, it were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an advantage and emolument to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and wicked men, that when they are dead, they might be freed from their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul, and improbity all at once: Whereas now it is manifeſt, that the Soul is immortal; a man hath no other way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Evils, and acquire ſecurity from future dangers, but to become as wiſe and virtuous as is poſſible. For the Soul departing hence to the Manſions of Ghoſts, carries along with it nothing but its former manners and education, which are ſaid to be of very great moment, either to the importance of Utility, or aggravation of loſs to him who is dead, when he firſt arrives there. And Tradition tells us, that every one of the dead is by that very <hi>Demon</hi> that attended on him living, purpoſely led into a certain place, where it is ordained, all Ghoſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together, muſt receive their Doom, and according to the form of Judgment ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:97884:131"/>
and conſtituted, go to the Infernal Manſions, with that Guide, to whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is given to conduct thoſe who are at thoſe places. But when they have obtained thoſe things they ought to obtain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there the time appointed; another Leader brings them back again, after many and long periods of time. But this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is not ſuch as <hi>Telephus</hi> in <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to be; for he affirms, there is but one way, and that Uniform too, that leads to the Infernal Manſions: whereas to me it ſeems more probable, the way is neither Uniform, nor Single: for if there were but one way, neither would there be any need of Guides, nor could any Soul go out of it. But now this ſeems to have many by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, diverſions, and intricate windings: whereof I make a conjecture from Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other Rites and Ceremonies belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to Religion, which are here perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Further, a moderate and prudent Soul, both follows his Guide willingly and chearfully, and knows things preſent: but a Soul fetter'd with ſenſe of Luſts, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Body (as we formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared] ſtill hankering after the Body with an affrighting and tumultuary error, and ſtriving much, and ſuffering much about a

But the Soul that hath led a life of purity and moderation, having obtained the Gods for both companions and Guides, inhabits that place, which hath been peculiarly and properly aſſigned unto it.</p>
                  <p>There are many and wonderful places of the Earth:<note place="margin">Coments of men concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of departed ſouls, vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</note> which yet is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch, nor ſo great as it is thought to be by ſome, who are wont to ſpeak of it, as I have heard

This then, ſaith he, I have fixed and eſtabliſhed in my belief; firſt, if the Earth be placed in the middle of the Univerſe, on all ſides en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by Heaven equally diſtant from it; then it needs not the defence or guard of any thing, either of the Aire, or of any

But that the pure Earth it ſelf is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a pure Heaven, wherein are the Stars, and what very many of thoſe who are wont to ſpeak of theſe matters, call <hi>Aether:</hi> the dreggs and ſediment whereof theſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97884:133"/>
things are, and flow together into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the earth. Yet that we who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in theſe Hollows, know not that we do ſo, but imagine that we dwell upon the higher parts of the Earth; as if a man dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the bottom of the Sea, ſhould think he dwelt above upon the Surface, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Sun and other Stars through the Water, conceive the Sea it ſelf to be Heaven: and by reaſon of the ſlowneſs and infirmity of his underſtanding, having never come up to the top of the Sea, nor beheld it, nor riſen up, and put his head above Water into this our place, could not know how much more beautiful and pleaſant this lightſom Region is, than that obſcure and deep one is, where he reſides: nor heard from any other who had ſeen our place. This (I ſay) is exactly our caſe: For, inhabiting in ſome Hollow of the Earth, we conceive, that we are ſeated upon the eminent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, and call the Air, Heaven: as if the Stars really moved through the Air, as Heaven; and we beheld their motions and wayes. And that herein we are ſo amuſed and confounded, that by reaſon of our ſlowneſs and infirmity, we cannot penetrate to the higheſt air. Since, if any ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the top of it, and as with wings fly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97884:133"/>
up thither, when he had gotten his head once above it, he would behold all theſe things clearly: juſt as if Fiſhes mounting up out of the Sea, ſhould behold our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo would he. And if he were by nature qualified for contemplation, he would ſoon know, that it is the true Heaven, and true Light, and true Earth; for both the Earth, and the Stones, and all this place are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and eaten away; as things in the Sea are, by the ſaltneſs thereof. Nor is any thing of value, any thing perfect bred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the Sea; but Caverns, and Sand, and an infinite quantity of mud and filth are in it, and where Earth is: which are in no reſpect to be compared to our Beauties. But thoſe Above ſeem to excel ours. Now to deſcribe what kind of Countries there are in the Earth, I ſhall think it no trouble to relate to you a Fable pleaſant, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your attention. That, ſaith <hi>Simmias,</hi> would we fain hear. In the beginning therefore, they ſay the face of the Earth appeared to the ſight ſuch, as (if a man looked down from on high, and ſurvey'd it) our little Balls made up of twelve ſquare pieces of Leather put together, various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral colours; not unlike the colours Painters uſe, as ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97884:134"/>
here with us: That there all the Earth doth conſiſt of theſe various colours, much more ſplendid, bright and pure then ours are: one, purple, exceedingly fair and deep; another, ſhining like Gold; but that which is white, is whiter than Chalk or Snow, and compoſed of other colours alſo, both more and more beautiful than have ever been ſeen by our eyes. Then that thoſe very Cavities of the Earth, being full of Water and Air, repreſent a certain kind of colour, ſhining through in a variety of other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, ſo that the form thereof may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived both ſimple and various at once. That herein thus conſtituted, the ſame things are in the ſame manner produced, Trees, Flowers, Fruits: and Mountains and Stones have the ſame forms and qualities, in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in perſpicuity, and in colours, far more beautiful than our pretious Stones are, which are but thin particles of thoſe; Sardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixes, and Jaſpers, and Emeralds, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of great price: and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there, but what vaſtly excells all our fineſt Rarities of the ſame ſort. That the cauſe of this vaſt difference is, becauſe the Stones there are pure, not (as ours are) fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and eaten by putrefaction and ſaltneſs, from the things that flow in together hither,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:97884:134"/>
and that produce diſeaſes and decayes in Stones, in Plants, and in Animals of our Earth. That the Earth it ſelf is every where adorned with ſuch fine productions, and moreover with Gold and Silver, and other Mettals: which naturally ſhine in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner, as being both very many, very great, and diſperſed through the whole Earth: ſo that to behold it, is a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſight to the happy Spectators. That there are in that Earth, living Creatures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of very many Kinds, and Men too: of whom ſome live in Mediterranean places, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about the Air, as we about the Sea; others in Iſlands, which the Air invirons, as ſcituate in the very Continent. In ſumme, in thoſe places, the Air is to them, what the Sea is to us, and ſerves them for the ſame uſes: only this, their Air is our <hi>Aether.</hi> And the ſeaſons of the year are with them ſo admirably conſtituted in point of temper, that the men there live both free from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and much longer than ours: and in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, underſtanding, and other the like faculties, they as far excel us, as Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels Water, and the <hi>Aether,</hi> Aire, in purity. That there are likewiſe Groves and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods, who reſide in them, and give Anſwers and Propheſies from Oracles; and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97884:135"/>
the men hold familiar converſation and commerce with Gods themſelves. That the Sun, and Moon, and other Stars are behe d by them clearly and diſtinctly as they are, and that they have this one felicity more to accompany them. That this is the form and conſtitution of the Earth, and the things that are about it. That there are places therein, and in the Hollows, and in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference thereof, many, ſome deeper and wider, in which we dwell; others dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per indeed, but of narrower mouths than that wherein we dwell: others again leſs profound than ours, but wider. That all theſe Cavities every where perforated one into another, and communicating by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground paſſages, have both by turnings and diverſions, as well in narrower as in broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der places; ſo that a vaſt plenty of Water flows out of ſome into others, as into Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns: and very great currents of Rivers, and perpetual ſprings of Waters, both cold and hot. Much fire alſo, whole Rivers of fire, and many ſtreams of Water, Muddy, and Pure, and Dirty: as thoſe Rivers in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> which flow from the Torrent called [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] the <hi>muddy</hi> River; and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it ſelf. That every one of thoſe places are filled, according to the quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:97884:135"/>
every day brought in; and that all theſe are moved up and down, like ſome hanging Veſſel upon the Earth. But this Penſil Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, by reaſon of ſome ſuch nature, is ſome one of the Gapings or Chaſms of the Earth; and the very biggeſt of all, piercing from ſide to ſide through the whole Earth; which <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf intimated in that Verſe, <q>Far hence in th' Earth there gapes a pit immenſe:</q>
Which both he elſewhere, and other Poets call <hi>Tartarus;</hi> and into which all Rivers have their confluence, re-flowing out of it by turns: But all Rivers are of the ſame nature as the Region is through which they run: and this is the cauſe why all both iſſue from thence, and return thither again: becauſe that Humid hath neither bottom nor foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; but is lifted up, and wavers upward and downward; and the air and breath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, doth the ſame: but follows it, both when it aſcends, and when it deſcends to us. And as in living Creatures endowed with Reſpiration, the Spirit or Breath is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and expired alternately: ſo here the Breath being raiſed up with moiſture, yeilds winds, ſtrong, &amp; in ungoverned force almoſt infinite, while it ruſheth in and out. But the Water, when ſtirred up by ſome impulſe, it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97884:136"/>
runs to that place, which is called <hi>Below;</hi> both flows into thoſe guſhing Lakes, and fills them; as thoſe who drink full bowls: and when it runs out from thence, in its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation tending thither again, it repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes the places here. They thus replete, it flows on through paſſages and channels of the Earth. When all Fountains and Streams arrive at thoſe places, whither Seas have more expeditely and opportunely flowed: they produce Lakes, Rivers, and Fountains. Thence going under ground again, ſome when they have travelled and compaſſed greater and more places, precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again into <hi>Tartarus,</hi> or the bottomleſs Gulph. ſome more deeply than whence they were exhauſted; others leſs deeply: but all flow in more deeply, than whence they flowed out. Some pour in themſelves through a part contrary to, and diſparate from that out of which they had their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux; others through the ſame. Some whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about in a circle, and once or often, in ſerpentine windings, Sires and ſpiral Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, infolding the Earth, as much as was poſſible; bowing downwards, impel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forward, to deſcend where way is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, to the very middle on each ſide, and no farther: for at each extreme Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97884:136"/>
each part is impervious. There are beſides theſe, many other Confluents of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters great and various: among all which are four, whereof the greateſt and deepeſt flowing in a round, is called the <hi>Ocean.</hi> By a motion contrary to this, flows <hi>Acheron;</hi> which comes in through other deſert places, and indeed running under ground, paſſes on to the <hi>Acheruſiad</hi> Mariſh, where crowds of departed Souls have their common rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; and whence, after certain periods of time predeſtined by Fate, to ſome longer, to others ſhorter, they are remitted hither again to the generation of Animals. Betwixt theſe two runs the <hi>third</hi> River, and not far from its Sours, diſembogues it ſelf into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great place, that burns with much fire, and there ſtagnating, makes a Mere or Lake greater than the Sea with us, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally boyling with water and mudd: hence it guſheth forth with violence, running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a round, troubled and full of filth; and having often fetched a compaſs under ground, pours it ſelf into the deepeſt part of <hi>Tartarus;</hi> paſſing to the Extremes of the <hi>Acheruſiad</hi> Mariſh, but not mixing with the Waters thereof. This is that River which they yet call <hi>Pyriphlegethon,</hi> the <hi>Burning</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Hell; whoſe Rivulets with violent
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97884:137"/>
force making way through the broaken Earth, riſe up whereſoever they can drill themſelves a vent. Oppoſite to this, the <hi>Fourth</hi> River falls firſt into a place horrid with mouldineſs and ſtinking damps, wild and ſavage (as they ſay) of a blew colour, which they call the <hi>Stygian</hi> place, that is the diſmal ſeat of <hi>hate, fear,</hi> and <hi>grief;</hi> and the River flowing into it, makes the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake; and falling in there, with mighty ſtrength re-inforcing its Torrent, and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it ſelf under ground, with a contrary flood, and various eddies, it throws it ſelf againſt the <hi>Burning</hi> River, and goes forward till it meets it in the <hi>Acheruſiad</hi> Mariſh: but mixes ſtreams with no other Waters, and here revolved in a circle, diſchargeth it ſelf into <hi>Tartarus,</hi> juſt oppoſite to the <hi>Burning</hi> River; and the name of it is (as Poets ſay) <hi>Cocytus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Purgatory</hi> of the antient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens deſcribed, with their <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> in Hell, and three parts thereof, <hi>Contrition, Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Satisfaction,;</hi> all which they ſaw to be neceſſary, by the light of <hi>Nature.</hi>

and impiety; they alſo who have lived in a middle way, going on to <hi>Acheron,</hi> and mounting into Waggons prepared for them, are therein carried to the Mariſh: where they both remain, and ſuffer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appointed for the expiation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation of their ſins. After they are thus expiated, they are abſolved and quitted: and every one receives rewards for their good deeds, according to their merits. But if for the greatneſs of their Crimes, they be found incurable, having committed either many or great Sacriledges, or unjuſt and unlawful Homicides, or ſuch execrable Wickedneſſes; a juſt lott caſteth them into <hi>Tartarus,</hi> from whence they never get out. Whereas they who ſtand convicted of, and obnoxious to ſins great indeed, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expiable; as they who have, in heat of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger committed any violence againſt Father or Mother, and truly repented of it all their life after; or who have been Homicides through immoderate paſſion: upon theſe is impoſed a neceſſity of falling into Hell. But when they have been there a year in Torments, the Waves caſt them forth: Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micides, by <hi>Cocytus;</hi> Killers of Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the <hi>Burning</hi> River. And when they come to the <hi>Acheruſiad</hi> Mariſh, then with a

loud voice they by name call, ſome thoſe whom they have killed, others, thoſe whom they have wronged, and begg and beſeech them to be ſatisfied with their unfeigned penitence, and grievous ſufferings, and to give them leave to depart out of that Mariſh. If they prevail, they retire thence, and are freed from thoſe miſeries: if not, they are carried back again into <hi>Tartarus,</hi> and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the other rivers, not ceaſing to ſuffer their renewed torments, untill they have obtained pardon from thoſe to whom they have been injurious; for this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is appointed for them by the decree of the Judges. Now they who have been rightly purged by Philoſophy, live ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without bodies, and come into other habitations fair and delightful; which to deſcribe, is too difficult for my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and too long for the ſhort remainder of my life.</p>

and care, that we may follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Virtue and Wiſdom, in this life. For the reward is great, and the hope good. That the deſcriptions I have recounted to you of the places and conditions of Souls after death, are true; becomes not a wiſe man to affirm. But that there are ſome ſuch, or the like, as for what concerns the ſtate and condition of our Souls, and the places whither they are to go for habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſeeing it is evident that our Souls are immortal, this alſo ſeems both conſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and worthy the danger, to believe they are ſuch. For the danger is honorable and glorious; and we are obliged to inculcate, and as it were inchant theſe things into our minds; wherefore I have been the more prolix in commemorating that Fable. But yet, as to what concerns a mans own Soul, he ought to be with full confidence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of theſe things, who while he hath lived, hath repudiated corporeal pleaſures, and outward Ornaments, as alien and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, and ſo hath reſolved to addict himſelf to any thing rather than to luſts of the body: and hath made it the grand bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his life, to furniſh his mind with learning, and to render it polite and brave, not with ſtrange, but its own proper orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97884:139"/>
namely with Temperance, Juſtice, Fortitude, Liberty, Truth. Thus armed, let him expect the time, when he is to take his Journey <hi>ad inferos,</hi> to the Manſions of Souls departed, and let him ſo prepare and addreſs himſelf, as to ſet forward redily and chearfully, whenſoever Fate ſhall call him. And for your parts, <hi>Simmias</hi> and <hi>Cebes,</hi> and the reſt that are here, ye ſhall all go this Journey, each in his appointed time: <hi>Fate</hi> (as the <hi>Tragedian</hi> ſaith) <hi>calls me now.</hi> But perhaps it is time for me to go and waſh my ſelf; for I think it more decent to be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before I drink the poyſon, that I may give the Women no trouble in waſhing my Body, after death.</p>

now ye make no promiſes, nor enter into new engagements: but if ye neglect your ſelves, and will not order your life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prints as it were, of what I now remonſtrate to you, &amp; what I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enjoyned ye; though ye ſhould even with vehement aſſeveration promiſe to do many, and great things, for my ſake, ye will do (I am ſure) nothing more.

               <p>Of theſe three parts of Luſtration inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gural, that accounted moſt efficacious, ſeems to have been <hi>Baptiſm</hi> or Waſhing: a thing of ſacred eſteem in all ages, and in all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; and among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by their wiſe Law-giver <hi>Moſes.</hi> For we read (<hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 14.) that when the Iſraelites were to be initiated to the holy Diſciplines by him inſtituted, he came down to the people, and ſanctified them, and they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97884:151"/>
                  <hi>waſhed</hi> their Garments: and by this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of their cloaths, Interpreters unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly underſtand the waſhing of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alſo; according to the very letter of that precept given, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Lavabit vestimenta, &amp; lavabit corpus aqua.</hi> Hence the Jews at this day deduce the origine of their <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> which that Nation hath ever ſince uſed with ſolemn Reverence, not only to the purgation of their external impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or to the ablution of their ſins; but alſo to the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of their <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> when they give up their names to <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> of whom <hi>Jethro,</hi> the Father-in-law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is accounted the firſt. For, the three rites of initiation to be obſerved by a Gentil converted, at his admiſſion into the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church or Congregation, are well known to be <hi>Circumciſion, Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Oblation.</hi> Concerning which our Prince of Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> profeſſedly diſcourſing, proves by many credible teſtimonies, that the Baptiſm of a Proſelyte was celebrated in the preſence of at leaſt three Elders, ſo ſoon as the wound of Circumciſion was healed, and in ſome river or fountain of living water, not in any veſſel or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bath, and never but once (on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97884:152"/>
either by the Proſelyt himſelf, or by any of his poſterity. Hereof the <hi>Effect</hi> was this, that a Proſelyt thus inaugurated, was held perfectly regenerate, and a new man, as an infant born of a new Mother, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with a new Soul from Heaven: ſo that being utterly deveſted of all former cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was thenceforth reputed to have no kindred, no affinity, either in right of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſal, or ſucceſſion to the goods of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, beſides thoſe who likewiſe had the character of Baptiſm. Upon which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing character it was, that <hi>Arrianus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, when (in <hi>Epictetum,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 9. he ſaid; <hi>quum quiſpiam induerit ſibi affectum Baptizati &amp; inter ſectatores aſciti, tunc &amp; eſt revera, &amp; appellatur Judaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though the <hi>Hebrews</hi> may have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Luſtration by Baptiſm, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of <hi>Moſes:</hi> yet it is not improbable, but he might firſt derive it from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> among whom he had ſo long lived, and in whoſe Learning as well ſacred as civil, he had been from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood educated. For, <hi>Apuleius Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos, Lib.</hi> 9.) being himſelf to be initiated to the Myſteries of <hi>Iſis,</hi> expreſly declares, that waſhing was in uſe among the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in all their ſacred Admiſſions: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97884:152"/>
the ceremonies of his own admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Sacerdos</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>stipatum me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioſa cohorte deducit ad proximas balneas; &amp; prius ſueto lavacro traditum praefarus Deum veniam, puriſſime circumrorans abluit,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is it to be doubted, but this was then done to him, <hi>de more antiquo,</hi> according to the moſt ancient uſe of that Nation. Which while the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> remain'd in bondage among them, were much more likely to give Examples to them, than to receive any from them: it being ſeldom obſerved, that Lords imitate their Slaves. But this is confirmed by <hi>Tertullian (de Baptiſmo cap.</hi> 5.) where he writes,; <hi>Nationes ſacris quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam per lavacrum initiantur, Iſidis alicujus, aut Mithrae</hi> [ſummi apud Perſas numinis] <hi>ipſos etiam Deos ſuos lavationibus efferunt,</hi> &amp;c. And whenceſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> borrowed this rite, we have it under the hand of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus Siculus (lib.</hi> 1.) that it was tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Athens</hi> by King <hi>Erech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is there juſt cauſe, why the tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the like Baptiſm from the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Christians,</hi> ſhould be urged to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of our Myſtical Ablution at the font, when by the Church we are admitted to Chriſtianiſm: as well becauſe ours was

            <p>BUT is it not of more importance to know, how <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> this Opinion of the perpetual duration of ſeparate Souls appears to be, than to inveſtigate the age and tradition of it? Certainly yes, and ſhould my Reader here require my eſtimate of the force and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the various Arguments or pretended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations brought by <hi>Plato</hi> in the precedent Dialogue, to evidence the verity thereof: I might juſtly enough make uſe of the licence thereby given me, to examine what I deſigned only to tranſlate. But becauſe it may be thought an indecency, if not ingratitude in a mere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, to cenſure the power and extent of the reaſonings uſed, and the concluſions thence drawn by his Author, and becauſe this lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble curioſity of the Reader (whom I preſume to be poſſeſſed with ſuch) may perhaps be more fully gratified, by a frank communication
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97884:160"/>
of my ſentiments concerning that more general Enquiry, viz. <hi>How far the Immortality of the Soul may be proved by ſimple reaſon, or the ſole light of Nature, without the illumination of ſacred Writ, or revelation Divine:</hi> I ſhall therefore with the freedom belonging to a Philoſopher, and due ſubmiſſion to more elevated Wits, adventure to acquaint him briefly with thoſe my thoughts; chooſing rather to expoſe them to his ſevereſt ſcrutiny, than by animadverſions upon the arguments of <hi>Plato</hi> in particular, to ſhew the leaſt umbrage or irreverence towards his memory.</p>
            <p>I confeſs then, that tho I have read, and with due attention of mind conſidered the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rigor of many Diſcourſes profeſſedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for, and ſpeciouſly promiſing a ſufficient eviction of the ſempiternal Exiſtence of the Rational Soul after death, by reaſons drawn only from her own excellent <hi>nature, faculties, affections, operations,</hi> &amp;c. yet I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that any one of them taken ſingle, or all put together, had the force of a perfect <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;</hi> ſo that were not the Light of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures infinitely more clear and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as to that among many other important truths concerning the Soul, I ſhould ſtill remain unaſſured of the endleſs Duration of my nobleſt part. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, as to the <hi>Origine</hi> of this excellent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Doctrines of Natural Philoſophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, are no leſs various then their Sects; and all but darkſom opinions, or precarious
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:97884:160"/>
conjectures. Nay even thoſe few among them, who held it to be of Divine Original, tho there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they hit the very white of truth, appear notwithſtanding to have ſhot wide, when they conceived it to have been Eternal <hi>ex parte ante,</hi> a particle of the Divine Eſſence it ſelf, and pre-exiſtent to its conjunction with the body. Whereas that ſacred Oracle, the Word of God plainly teaches, that the Soul of the firſt man was created immediately by God himſelf, and united to the body then already perfectly formed and prepared to receive it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to the grand Difficulty, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Exemption</hi> of it from the power of <hi>Death,</hi> when thereby divorced from the body; the Arguments brought from <hi>Phyſical Mediums</hi> for probation hereof, do indeed ſuffice to convince us of the <hi>Spirituality</hi> and <hi>Seperability</hi> of the Soul: but ſuffice not (in my judgement at leaſt) to demonſtrate the <hi>impoſſibility of its deſtruction,</hi> or that <hi>abſolutely</hi> it ſhall ſurvive the diſſolution of the body for ever the ſame.</p>
            <p>I grant, that ſome, and chiefly that moſt rigid of Phyſico-Mathematicians, <hi>Des Cartes (in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditat. Metaphyſic. de Anima, &amp; reſpon. ad object. ſecund.)</hi> have gone ſo far, as fairly to convince any man of competent underſtanding, that the Soul, tho in this life obliged to act for the moſt part, by the Organs of the Senſes, doth yet diſcover its excellency, by actions proper and peculiar to her ſpiritual nature, wholly indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon, and diſtinct from the Senſes: and thence by genuine conſequence inferred, that the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:97884:161"/>
ſame Soul, tho by a ſtrict and intimate conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the body, united into one <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> therewith, is yet nevertheleſs a thing or <hi>ſubſtance diſtinct</hi> from the body. I grant alſo, that by this very Argument the Immortality of the Soul may be ſufficiently proved againſt <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> For theſe men taking the Soul to be, not formally and truly a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but only a certain <hi>Modiſication</hi> of body; thereupon concluded, that it muſt of neceſſity periſh, or ceaſe to be the ſame, when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique or frame of the body, from whence it reſulted, is deſtroyed by Death. If therefore from ſome <hi>intellectual operations</hi> of this Soul, ſuch to which matter or body, however mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, or organized, cannot poſſibly reach; it be made appear (and <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſeems to have done it) that ſhe is a Subſtance diſtinct from, and independent upon the body: there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no reaſon, much leſs an abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, why the diſſolution of the body ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the deſtruction of the Soul, as they imagine; more eſpecially if the latter be conceived to be (what moſt certainly it is) a ſimple and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſubſtance, as incapable of deſtruction, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hold matter to be.</p>
            <p>But I dare not grant, that this <hi>Carteſian</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration holds good, as againſt <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who exclude God from having any hand in the creation and conſervation of the Soul; ſo likewiſe againſt thoſe who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be the ſole Creator and preſerver of all things. For, admitting the Soul to be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97884:161"/>
both a ſubſtance diſtinct from the body, and immediately created, and continualy conſerved by God: yet can we not lawfully infer from thence, that it is not poſſible for ſuch a Soul <hi>ever to ceaſe to be.</hi> For what aſſurance can ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reaſon give us, that God hath not ordained, that this Soul, as it had a beginning when it was created to be infuſed into the body, ſo at the time of its ſeparation from the body, ſhall loſe its being, and vaniſh into its primitive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? That the duration thereof neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Gods conſerving power and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is undeniable: and it ſeems conſentaneous, that as the Union or Aſſociation of the Soul to the Body was at firſt made, not by any Agents meerly Natural, but upon conditions depending ſolely upon Gods free and arbitrary inſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo (for ought we can learn from the weak light of Nature to the contrary) one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions may be, that at the diſſolution of that Union, both Body and Soul ſhould ceaſe to be. Eſpecially ſince to the Souls relapſing into its firſt nothing, no more is required, but Gods withdrawing his conſerving influence, by which alone all his Creatures are ſupported, and their Being is preſerved. Here then we find our ſelves left in the dark by human reaſon; ſo that were it not for the brighter beams of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation Divine, how fair ſoever our <hi>hopes</hi> might be of <hi>Immortality,</hi> we ſhould want a full <hi>aſſurance</hi> of it. To conclude therefore this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rergon,</hi> with the concordant judgement, and in the moſt elegant words of that moſt excellent

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97884:166"/>
but this I will adventure to confeſs, that to me they appear as idle and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, as the works of <hi>Didymus</hi> a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian did to <hi>Seneca,</hi> Who (<hi>in Epiſt.</hi> 88.) derides him for writing 4000 Volumes, wherein he chiefly enquires about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country of <hi>Homer,</hi> the true Mother of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> whether <hi>Anacreon</hi> were more addicted to wine or women; whether <hi>Sappho</hi> were a common proſtitute, and other the like ridiculous impertinences, which were to be forgotten, if you knew them. Wherefore leaving theſe diſſenting Expoſitors, let us reſume our clue, and follow the trace of the Fiction it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Homer</hi> conſtituted <hi>Rhadaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> and his brother <hi>Minos</hi> Judges in the infernal Arches (<hi>Odyſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 567.) and fetch'd thoſe names from <hi>Crete:</hi> yet the ground or example was derived from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as appears from this relation of <hi>Diodorus Siculus (lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 58.) <q>Among the Aegyptians (ſaith he) when a dead body is to be interred, the Kindred of the deceaſed give notice of the day to the Judges, and to the friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the defunct; and proclam that he is at that time to be wafted
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:97884:166"/>
over the Lake. At the day prefix'd, more then 40 Judges aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeat themſelves in a Semicircle or Half-moon, on the brink of the Lake: and a Boat ready prepared for that uſe, is lanched, with a man therein to row it, whom they in the Aegyptian language call <hi>Charon.</hi> Then, before the body is put aboard, it is permitted to every man preſent, to bring in what accuſations he thinks juſt, againſt the party deceaſed. If any prove, that he lived an evil life, the Judges immediately give ſentence upon him according to the nature and quality of his tranſgreſſions: and the body is forbidden to be buried. But a falſe and malicious accuſer is obnoxious to to great penalties. When no juſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment is brought in, the kindred laying aſide the mourning and laments, praiſe the defunct, in their laudatory harangues, not mentioning the nobility of his blood and extraction (as the the Grecians uſe to do) becauſe they hold, that all in Aegypt are equaly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble; but his good Education in youth, and the piety, juſtice, continency, and other virtues of his maturer age, all
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97884:167"/>
which they particularly recount and celebrate.</q> This funeral Oration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they addreſs their Oraiſons to the infernal Deities, beſeeching them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into the Society of the Pious: with no ſmall devotion making this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the form whereof hath been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and tranſmitted down to us by <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius (de Abſtinentia lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.)</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O Lord Sun, and all ye Gods who give life to men, receive me, and deliver me a companion to the immortal Gods. For while I lived here in this age, I piouſly worſhipped the Gods whom my Parents taught me to worſhip: and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd thoſe who begat me: nor have I killed any man: nor defrauded any that truſted me: nor committed any inexpiable evil. But if at any time of my life, I have offended by eating or dtinking any thing forbidden; I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not by my ſelf, but by thoſe bowells of mine there (pointing to a little Coffin wherein the ſtomach and gutts are repoſed apart.</q>)</p>
               <p>Which ſaid, the ſpeaker throws the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Coffin into the water, as containing
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:97884:167"/>
the offending parts; and the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with loud and ingeminated applauſes recommending the defunct (that is, him who had performed all the dueties of life) as one that ſhall enjoy the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting converſation of pious Souls <hi>apud inferos;</hi> the body is put into the Boat, and ferried over the Lake to be inhumed.</p>
               <p>Here reflecting upon this Aegyptian praier, or Apology rather, made in the name of the dead, we may <hi>en paſsant</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, both a touch of Phariſaical arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and ſelf-juſtification; and precepts exactly concordant with thoſe given, firſt (as the tradition of the Talmudical Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines teacheth) to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and afterward by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the ſecond Table of the Decalogue, and from them deſcended down to us. So that that ſaying of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is new under the Sun,</hi> was true many hundred of years before his daies, yea and before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s too. But I have made a digreſſion of a praier; and muſt return into the little remainder of my way.</p>
               <p>From theſe Aegyptian obſequies it was (as the ſame <hi>Diodorus</hi> in the ſame place
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:97884:168"/>
obſerves) that <hi>Orpheus</hi> having, while he ſojourned among their Prieſts, curiouſly remarked them, firſt invented his fiction of Hell; in ſome things keeping cloſe to the original he copied, and adding others from the mint of his own Poetical phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and ſo divulging the ſame to his admirers in <hi>Greece,</hi> tranſmitted it to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as matter of Faith.</p>
               <p>From their belief, that Good Souls were after death advanced to the honour and felicity of converſing with the Gods, firſt aroſe the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Ancients: and firſt of all <hi>Hercules</hi> was, for his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic virtues, accordingly Deified. Whence <hi>Homer</hi> deſcribing the tranſcendent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his condition, ſaith, <hi>apud Deos immortales oblectatur in convivijs, &amp; habet pulchris talis Hebem:</hi> by aſſigning him <hi>Hebe</hi> or <hi>Youth</hi> for a Wife, intimating his <hi>Immortality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from the Aegyptian cuſtom of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicting ſepulture to the bodies of men convicted of great crimes, came the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Grecians, that the Souls of men whoſe bodies want interrment, are repulſed by <hi>Charon.</hi> Whence in <hi>Homer,</hi> the Ghoſt of <hi>Elpinor</hi> appearing to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:97884:168"/>
complains of his repulſe, becauſe his body yet remained unburied. So doth that of <hi>Patroclus</hi> to <hi>Achilles,</hi> begging the human office of inhumation: <hi>ſepeli me quam citiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſime; ut intrem portas Plutonis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe remarkable inſtances of Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude betwixt the old Aegyptian rites of burial, and the Grecian fictions <hi>de inferis;</hi> I might, were not my pen already blunted with the drudgery of tranſcription, add many others collected by <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi> But from what I have alleaged, it ſeems clearly evident, that the original of the Grecian traditions and doctrin concerning Hell, was fetch'd from Aegypt: and that the grand pipe through which they were tranſmitted and diffuſed, was the pen of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who flouriſhed about the year 676 of the <hi>Attic Aera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it leſs manifeſt, that ſome <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> alſo, and thoſe too of great name and autority in their times, laboured by their Writings to propagate the belief of the ſame Phantaſtical comments in the minds of the ſuperſtitious vulgar. For, <hi>Diogenes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius,</hi> in the lives of <hi>Democritus</hi> and his Scholar <hi>Protagoras,</hi> of <hi>Antisthenes</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclides Ponticus,</hi> expreſly delivers, that
